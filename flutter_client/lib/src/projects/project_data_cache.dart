/// Shared project-data cache — the fix for two related costs:
///
/// 1. Switching between view mode and manage mode re-downloaded everything
///    from scratch even though the other mode had just fetched the same
///    project seconds earlier (each screen owned its own notifier instance
///    with no way to hand data to the other).
/// 2. On Android/iOS, reopening a project after the app was fully closed
///    re-downloaded the same multi-MB geo/elevation payloads every time,
///    even when nothing about the trip had changed.
///
/// This cache sits underneath [ProjectService] (see its call sites), not
/// inside the notifiers — both `ProjectNotifier` and the view-mode/shared
/// subclasses go through the same `ProjectService` methods, so caching there
/// benefits every screen for free without touching their loading logic.
///
/// Two layers:
///  - L1: an in-memory map, live for the app process. This alone fixes (1).
///  - L2: an sqflite-backed store, native platforms only (web has no
///    filesystem — see the conditional import below). This is what fixes (2).
///
/// Freshness is driven by `lock_version`, the project's optimistic-lock
/// counter (bumped server-side by content-mutating writes, now echoed in the
/// `/meta` and full-details responses — see `ProjectIO.to_dict`). `/meta` is
/// cheap and already fetched on every load, mutation-reload and background
/// poll in this app, so it doubles as the freshness oracle for free: every
/// time it's fetched, [onMetaFetched] compares the lock_version it carries
/// against what this cache has on file for the project and drops the heavy
/// entries (low-res geo, full-res geo, full details/elevation) the moment
/// they no longer match. Nothing here ever *invents* a lock_version or trusts
/// elapsed time — a stale entry is only ever detected by comparing against a
/// live server response.
///
/// One accepted race: `ProjectNotifier.load()` fires `getDetailsMeta` and
/// `getLowResGeo` in parallel (issue #178 — sequencing them would slow down
/// every fresh load to save a rare edge case). So a low-res-geo read can, in
/// the narrow window before the concurrent meta call lands, return an entry
/// that meta is about to invalidate. This is judged acceptable because the
/// low-res geo is *already* a disposable placeholder in this app's design —
/// every load unconditionally replaces it with full-res geometry moments
/// later — and that full-res fetch always runs *after* meta has resolved, so
/// it never inherits the race. Worst case: one low-res paint briefly shows a
/// trip's previous shape before the usual progressive upgrade corrects it,
/// exactly like an ordinary cold load already looks while full-res geometry
/// streams in.
