// Issue #337. `_buildFullTrack` flattened the trip's GeoJSON coordinates into
// Float64List buffers on the UI isolate, immediately before handing them to
// the compute() hop that consumes them — measured at 22.6 ms on a real trip,
// the only span left over the 16.7 ms frame budget after #335.
//
// The buffers are now produced by the decode worker that is already holding
// those coordinates (`decodeGeoOffIsolate`) and come back on its zero-copy
// return, so the UI isolate never walks them. These tests pin the two halves
// that matter: the seeded path does *zero* flattening on the UI isolate, and
// a geo that never went through that worker still builds the same track
// rather than an empty one.
//
// heavy_decode_test.dart covers the seeding itself at the cache level; this
// file covers it end-to-end through ProjectNotifier, which is where the stall
// was measured.
