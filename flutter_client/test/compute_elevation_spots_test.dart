// computeElevationSpots — the concatenate+LTTB-downsample computation
// elevation_chart.dart runs via `compute()` on a background isolate when the
// unfiltered (no activity selected) elevation series is large. See
// elevation_chart.dart's doc comment on computeElevationSpots for why: a
// long trip's full elevation payload, concatenated across every activity,
// can be tens of thousands of points, and doing that synchronously on the
// UI isolate is the same mistake the day-carousel ANR fix corrected
// elsewhere (map_panel.dart's buildDayIndex). This only exercises the pure
// computation itself, same scope as build_day_index_test.dart.

  // tests/test_elevation_downsample.py. The server picks its interior points
  // by LTTB instead, so what survives this stand-in survives the real thing.
