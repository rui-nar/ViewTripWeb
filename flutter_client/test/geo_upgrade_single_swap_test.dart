// Issue #293 — the low-res -> full-res geo upgrade must reach the UI as ONE
// swap, not a staged reveal. See docs/PERF_MAP_LOAD.md.
//
// _loadFullGeoProgressively used to replace the track a few activities at a
// time, notifying after each batch (~8 repaints, 80 ms apart). Every one of
// those notifications rebuilds the whole tree — each polyline spec, each
// marker spec, a compute() decimation hop, ActivityPanel, ElevationChart —
// which is what issue #276 reported as "small local blocks and unblocks": a
// metronome of hitches, because the cause was literally a metronome.
//
// The invariant pinned here is deliberately about what the UI *observes*, not
// about how the notifier is implemented: across a whole load, listeners may
// only ever be handed two distinct geo objects — the low-res one, then the
// full-res one.
