// Issue #276, option 1 of the agreed plan.
//
// `fullTrack` and `perActivityTracks` exist to map a distance to a position —
// for the map-to-chart cursor, and for hitTestMapTap's nearest-point scan.
// They draw nothing; the rendered polylines come from `geo` and are capped
// separately by kMaxTotalPolylinePoints.
//
// The device diagnostics measured 1,465,345 points in each, on a 219-activity
// trip: roughly 200 MB held to answer a question a fraction of that resolves,
// and a linear scan of 1.5 M points on every map tap. It regressed in #295,
// where removing the index-aligned pairing made the track follow the geometry
// (~6,700 points per activity) rather than the elevation profile (~300).
