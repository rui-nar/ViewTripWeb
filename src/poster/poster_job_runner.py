"""Background runner for async A0 poster-generation jobs (issue #14).

``run_poster_job`` is invoked via ``BackgroundTasks.add_task`` from
``api/poster.py`` right after a ``DBPosterJob`` row is created with
status="pending". The actual rendering (basemap + route + memory pins/cards)
lives in ``src/poster/poster_renderer.py`` (Unit E) — this module owns only
the job-row lifecycle: marking it "running", invoking the renderer with a
``progress`` callback that updates ``job.stage`` between steps, and marking it
"done"/"failed" with the resulting file paths or error. Once a terminal state
is committed it also sends a best-effort notification email (issue #14
follow-up) with a download link — the Flutter client no longer polls for
completion, so email is the only thing that tells the user their poster is
ready (or failed).

``mark_job_interrupted``/``sweep_orphaned_poster_jobs`` cover the case
``run_poster_job``'s own try/except cannot: a poster render is memory-heavy
enough that the RQ work-horse running it can be OOM-killed outright (SIGKILL)
rather than raising a catchable Python exception — the process is just gone,
mid-render, with nothing left to run the ``except`` block or send the email.
Left alone the job row stays "running" forever and the user — who was
explicitly told "we'll email you when it's ready" — never hears anything at
all. Unlike a route job's transient network hiccup, a poster OOM is a
deterministic property of that job's own inputs (bounds size, photo count),
so neither path retries; both go straight to "failed" plus the same
notification email a normal failure would send.
