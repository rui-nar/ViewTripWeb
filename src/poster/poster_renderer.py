"""Real A0 poster rendering (issue #14).

Wires together the tile stitcher (``tile_stitcher.render_basemap``), the type
scale (``typography.TypeScale``), content-driven card measurement
(``card_layout.layout_card``), route-aware placement
(``card_placement.place_cards``) and per-day metrics
(``day_metrics.compute_day_metrics``) into the actual PNG/PDF poster.

Layers:
  - ``assemble_card_content`` is pure Python (no Pillow) — given the request's
    ``config`` flags, one memory dict, and its computed day metrics, it returns
    an ordered list of content blocks. Fully unit-testable.
  - ``card_layout.layout_card`` measures those blocks into positioned drawing
    ops and an exact card height.
  - ``_compose_poster_image`` turns ops, a stitched basemap and placed
    rectangles into pixels at whatever size/DPI its caller asks for.
  - ``render_poster`` (full resolution, saves PNG+PDF) and
    ``render_poster_preview`` (small/fast, returns PNG bytes) are thin callers
    of ``_compose_poster_image``.

Everything physical — type sizes, card dimensions, padding, pin radius — is
specified in points or millimetres and converted using the render's DPI, so the
preview, the 150 DPI render and a 300 DPI render are the same design at
different resolutions rather than three different-looking outputs.

    Pure and Pillow-free so it's unit-testable without any image library.
    ``card_layout.layout_card`` turns the returned blocks into positioned
    drawing ops. Each block is a dict shaped ``{"kind": <str>, ...}``;
    ``kind`` determines the rest of its fields:

      - ``name`` / ``description`` / ``date``: ``{"text": str}``
      - ``day_badge``: ``{"day_number": int}``

    content is a content-free box with a leader line pointing at it, so such a
    memory belongs in the legend instead (see ``_compose_poster_image``).

    ``day_badge`` and ``name`` are deliberately *outside* that gating and are
    prepended, in that order, to any card that has content at all. They identify
    which memory the card belongs to; without them a card showing only distance

    and painted flat grey, which is why the map "looked grey" no matter what
    the token or network were doing.

    The tile budget is deliberately tiny (``_PREVIEW_MAX_TILES``), so the
    preview stays sub-second and cheap; at preview size the chosen zoom needs
    only a handful of tiles anyway. If the basemap can't be fetched, the
    preview still renders (on flat grey) and returns a warning describing why,
    rather than failing outright or quietly implying the poster will be grey.

    The whole call — basemap fetch AND card rendering — also carries a single
    wall-clock deadline (``_PREVIEW_TOTAL_BUDGET_S``, see
    ``_compose_poster_image``): a low-DPI preview canvas can fit far more tiny
    cards than "the tile budget is small" suggests, and each one's drop-shadow
    blur/photo decode is real work, so a tile-count cap alone didn't stop a
    real preview from running past the client's own timeout (issue #14).
    Past the deadline, cards degrade to legend rows instead of being drawn.

    Returns ``(png_bytes, warning_or_None)``.
