"""Email-verification tokens (issue #110).

Registration stores whatever address the user typed. Verification is what turns
that self-declared string into evidence that they can actually read mail there —
without it, anyone could register with someone else's address and claim a
pending invite meant for them.

The gate is deliberately **soft**: an unverified account is fully usable. It may
not send invite emails and is not matched to a pending invite, and nothing else
changes. A hard gate would make the mail relay a hard dependency of signup, so
a Brevo outage or a message in a spam folder would mean nobody can register.
