"""Full account deletion — every row and file owned by a user.

Shared by the self-service ``DELETE /api/auth/me`` and the admin-triggered
``DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}``. A single implementation avoids the two paths
drifting out of sync (or one of them leaking data the other cleans up).

DB rows are deleted first (children before parents, matching FK direction even
though SQLite enforcement is off in this project — Postgres deployments do
enforce it). On-disk files live under ``data/users/{id}/`` and must be purged
*outside* the DB session, mirroring the storage-walk pattern in
``src.admin.storage``.
