    Strava enforces 100 requests per 15 minutes *and* 1000 per day, per
    application — not per user, not per request. A limiter is therefore only
    meaningful if every caller in the process shares one; see
    :data:`_SHORT_TERM_LIMITER` / :data:`_DAILY_LIMITER` below.

    ``acquire`` waits at most ``max_wait`` seconds for a free slot and then
    raises, rather than blocking indefinitely. A shared limiter genuinely fills
    up, and a request thread parked for the remainder of a 15-minute window (or
    the rest of the day, for the daily quota) turns a quota problem into an
    outage. Callers that can defer work check :attr:`remaining` first and
    reschedule instead — see ``_enrich_activities`` in api/activities.py.
