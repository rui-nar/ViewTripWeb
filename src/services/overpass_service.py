Overpass API service — extracts railway geometry from OpenStreetMap.

Two strategies (tried in order):
  3a  Route-relation strategy: query OSM train route relations containing
      both station nodes (matched by uic_ref tag).  The relation's member
      ways are routed start→end through a node graph (Dijkstra) rather than
      naively chained — train relations include double-track ways, sidings
      and station tracks that would otherwise produce a self-overlapping line.
  3b  Coordinate fallback: query railway ways inside the bounding box,
      build a node graph, and route with Dijkstra between the two nearest
      nodes to start/end coords.

    physically connected. Greedily chaining their member ways walks into and out
    of every stub *and teleports across any gap between disconnected ways* —

    rail at 3031 km vs ~970 km of real track; a far-north Norway ferry rendered
    with 80 km + 50 km mid-route straight jumps where chaining stitched
    disconnected coastal ferry ways together).

    Routing start→end through the relation's own member-way node graph (Dijkstra)
    instead yields a shortest on-graph path that visits each node at most once —
    no backtracking, no double-track duplication, and structurally no teleports
    (an edge exists only between vertices actually adjacent within a way).
    Returns None when there is no on-graph path at all, so the caller falls

    whatever it comes within that many metres of. Nothing else may bridge, and
    the limit is 250 m against the 116 km this docstring is otherwise about.

    **What comes back is the best path this relation offers, not a promise that
    it runs between these two stops.** Since #359 the endpoints are snapped
    inside one connected component (see ``_snap_endpoints``), so a relation
    whose graph is in pieces returns its best piece instead of nothing — which
    is what recovers a route whose station throat is disconnected upstream, and

    three candidate relations, all with ``missing_members = 0`` and no platform
    member, so neither of #359's fixes applies — and all three are in pieces
    anyway, because OSM's membership does not join the Montparnasse station

    that reaches Bordeaux, and the leg is drawn starting 3.5 km late, from the
    Petite Ceinture. Overpass returns the same gap; there is no track to find.

    What there *is* is the relation saying, in its own node members, that it
    calls at Paris Montparnasse — and a 322-node component that reaches within
    13 m of it and stops 100 m short of the main line. So: find the stop this
    relation names at each end of the leg, find the component holding it, and

    * Only a component that reaches a *named* stop bridges outward, so this can

      leg's endpoints gets no bridge at all and is still refused by
      ``_ENDPOINT_TOLERANCE_KM``.
    * And never the component the route already runs on, however it was named
      — see ``main`` below. Without that, the far endpoint's stop makes the
      main line a home and the first restriction buys nothing.
    * One edge per other component, at its closest approach. With at most two
      homes that bounds an invented *path* at two edges, not one: two broken
      throats either side of a shared fragment can each bridge to it. So the
      hard guarantee is **at most two invented edges, each at most
      ``_COMPONENT_BRIDGE_M``** — 500 m against the 116 km Hanko→Salo teleport,
      and ``_rail_length_ok`` still weighs the result.
    * The metre limit is checked exactly, on the same equirectangular
      approximation ``_dijkstra`` weights its edges with, so what is drawn is
      what was measured.

# Strategy 3c — coordinate fallback (bounding-box Dijkstra)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Maximum *area* (square degrees) of the buffered bounding box for the single
# coordinate-fallback query. Beyond this Overpass cannot answer inside the
# 30 s QL / 45 s HTTP budget, so we straight-line instead of paying for a
# request that can only fail.
#
# This was 12.0 degrees of max *span*, chosen as a "pathological input" guard
# rather than from anything Overpass can serve, and it let through queries that
# could only time out: the Hamburg→Offenburg report (issue #277) sent a box that
# ran 43.4 s, returned 61 MB and still hit Overpass's own query timeout — ~135 s
# across three mirrors to land on the straight line it would have produced
# instantly.
#
# Span is the wrong axis. Cost tracks the area actually queried and the density
# of rail inside it, and a max-span cap tight enough for Germany throws away
# routes that sparse networks serve easily. Measured on overpass-api.de with
# this exact query (railway=rail|narrow_gauge|light_rail, service unset,
# out geom), each on its real buffered box:
#
#     Hamburg→Hannover      1.28 deg^2    8.4 s    6.2 MB   ok
#     Helsinki→Oulu         5.57 deg^2   10.4 s    3.8 MB   ok
#     Helsinki→Rovaniemi    8.80 deg^2    6.1 s    4.2 MB   ok
#     central Germany 3.0°   9.00 deg^2   32.3 s   37.0 MB   ok  <- dense ceiling
#     Hamburg→Offenburg    14.28 deg^2   43.4 s   61.0 MB   QUERY TIMED OUT
#     central Germany 4.0°  20.25 deg^2   51.6 s   71.0 MB   past the HTTP timeout
#
# 9.0 is therefore the densest network's measured ceiling. Sparse networks clear
# it with 5x margin, which is why Helsinki→Rovaniemi — the very route
# _via_coordinate_fallback exists for — still reaches the query, while
# Hamburg→Offenburg is rejected in ~0 s instead of after minutes. A degenerate
# long-thin box stays bounded because the 0.25° buffer on each side puts a floor
# of 0.5° under both dimensions.
#
# Issue #345 note: this cap outlives Overpass. The local store (src/rail/) reads
# a bbox's worth of ways into memory, ~268 bytes per vertex and again as much
# once _build_rail_graph runs, so an unbounded box is an OOM on a 1 GB worker
# rather than a timeout. RailStore.ways_in_bbox refuses one from its side; this
# is the same bound from the caller's. Do not retire it with the rest of the
# Overpass scaffolding in Phase 6.

    A cached answer short-circuits everything below — including the concurrency
    gate, since queueing to answer from memory would be absurd.

    Otherwise one attempt per endpoint, in order, skipping any host currently
    cooling. Every failure marks the host and moves on; nothing is retried in
    band. That is deliberate and it is policy, not taste: overpass-api.de asks
    for a 30 second pause after a 429, and its operators ban clients that
    repeatedly trigger one — the *rate* of 429s being a trigger by itself. An
    in-request retry loop maximises exactly that rate.

    An earlier version of this function waited ~5s and retried the same host up
    to three times, on the reasoning that a busy host is cheaper to wait out than
    a dead mirror is to discover. The first half was right and the second half
    was the documented ban trigger; this deployment's IPv4 address was blocked
    within minutes of shipping it. Cooling the host achieves what waiting was
    for — not stampeding to a worse endpoint — without the retries.

    Every attempt is recorded and surfaced on the final error, so a resolve that
    degrades can say which hosts refused it and why.
