"""Train schedule + track geometry, resolved through MOTIS (Transitous).

Turns a train number and a service date into an ordered list of stops **and**
the real track polyline of that journey, using the public MOTIS instance at
https://api.transitous.org.

Why this replaced the four HAFAS provider backends
--------------------------------------------------
Every bespoke backend this module used to carry is dead or not worth a second
code path (verified against the live endpoints, issue #277):

* ``db``  — ``v6.db.transport.rest`` answers **503** on every API path. DB
  switched its HAFAS endpoint off permanently; the wrapper now proxies
  ``db-vendo-client``, which has a ~60 req/min quota and, per its own readme,
  "haphazard blocking".
* ``obb`` — ``oebb.macistry.com`` answers 503 "This service has been suspended
  by its owner."
* ``dsb`` — ``xmlopen.rejseplanen.dk`` answers HTTP **299** with an HTML page
  saying API 1.0 is closed. 299 is a 2xx, so ``raise_for_status()`` never
  fired and the old code called ``.json()`` on HTML.
* ``vr``  — ``rata.digitraffic.fi`` is healthy, but the same Finnish data
  (``fi-digitraffic``) is in the Transitous index, so it no longer earns its
  own wire format.

Both ``db-rest`` and ``db-vendo-client`` now point users at Transitous as the
migration path, and one MOTIS index covers DE/AT/DK/FI in a single API. The
``hafas_provider`` field is therefore vestigial: stored segments still carry it
and it is still persisted, but resolution ignores it.

Two defects disappear with the move:

1. **Match on a departure board, not a journey planner.** The old lookup asked
   ``/journeys`` for 15 results from a hardcoded 06:00+01:00 and passed
   ``lineName=<train>`` — a parameter ``hafas-rest-api``'s journeys route does
   not have, so it was silently ignored and the code just scanned 15 arbitrary
   journeys. ICE 75 leaves Hamburg Hbf at 14:29 local with 275 rail departures
   ahead of it on the board: it could never be found. ``/stoptimes`` is indexed
   by stop and time, so a train-number lookup is an exact scan of the service
   day instead of a 15-result guess.
2. **``/trip`` returns ``legGeometry``** — the whole journey's real track as an
   encoded polyline — so a matched train needs no Overpass query at all. That
   removes the bounding-box query cascade (3 mirrors x 45 s) from the train
   path entirely. ``overpass_service.get_rail_geometry`` remains the fallback
   for segments with no train number, or whose train could not be matched.

Raises HafasError on any failure — callers fall back to coordinate-only mode.
