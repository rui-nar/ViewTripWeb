"""Pure geometry helpers for editing an activity's track (issue #31).

Two responsibilities, both side-effect-free and standalone-testable:

1. **Canonical point list** — align ``summary_polyline`` (full-resolution track,
   every latlng re-encoded) with the parallel ``elevation_profile``
   (``distances_km`` / ``elevations_m``) into one ordered list of
   ``TrackPoint(lat, lng, elev)``.  Elevation is interpolated onto the polyline
   points by cumulative distance, since the two arrays are not guaranteed to be
   index-aligned.  ``points_to_polyline`` / ``points_to_elevation_profile``
   re-derive the storage arrays after an edit.

2. **Metric recomputation** — :func:`recompute_track_metrics` derives distance,
   elevation gain, hi/lo, start/end latlng, average speed, and *apportioned*
   moving/elapsed times for an edited (trimmed / split / point-edited) piece.
   Times are apportioned proportionally to retained distance because no

    Noise cannot be inferred from how the track was sampled, which is what
    issue #376 is about. Spacing says nothing about the source: a non-barometric
    phone, a Garmin on smart recording and a track simplified before upload are
    all sparse AND noisy, while a route planner's DEM export is sparse and
    clean. So measure it instead of guessing from geometry.

    The measurement is a median absolute k-th difference scaled back to a
    standard deviation. Differencing a series k times annihilates any local
    polynomial of degree below k, so terrain must bend more sharply than a
    degree-k polynomial to register at all, while independent noise — having no
    shape to annihilate — always survives at ``sigma * sqrt(C(2k, k))``.

    Two properties follow, and both were premises the previous estimator got
    wrong:

    * **Curvature.** Second differences (what it used) are near zero only on a
      STRAIGHT flank; they scale with the square of the spacing on any bend, so
      a clean curved route at 100 m spacing read as sigma 2 and earned a 5 m
      band that erased its rollers whole. Higher differences vanish on a bend
      too: clean sinusoidal rollers of 10 m over 600 m at 100 m spacing measure
      sigma 0.23 here, against 0.83 from second differences.
    * **Scale.** Whatever terrain still shows through shrinks with every added
      order — for anything longer than ~3.4 samples per cycle — while the noise
      estimate is unchanged by construction. So take the SMALLEST estimate over
      a run of orders: the one least contaminated by terrain. Orders 3 to 5;
      order 2 is the discredited one, and by order 6 the minimum of six noisy
      estimates starts biasing sigma low (a true 1.2 measured 1.08, enough to
      let 32 m of phantom climb back into held-altitude flat ground).

# ── Terrain-model gain: the flatness oracle (issue #386) ──────────────────────
#
# Everything above works on one series of elevations over distance, and that is
# why the phantom climb on a phone recording cannot be removed there. Correlated
# sensor drift and gentle terrain have the SAME SPECTRUM on the distance axis:
# they are not separable, which was established by sweeping every span x
# threshold pair, and by PR #389 measuring the marginal sigma correctly and
# erasing up to 100% of a real 1000 m day for it. The time axis does not rescue
# it either — at roughly constant speed time and distance are one axis up to a
# scale factor.
#
# So this does not try. It brings in a SECOND, INDEPENDENT measurement — the
# elevation a terrain model reports along the same path — and uses it for the one
# question it can answer without ambiguity: *is there any relief here at all?*
#
# Where the terrain model says there is none, every metre the sensor reported is
# invented, and the terrain model's own steps replace it. Where the terrain model
# sees relief, the recording stands untouched -- and the justification for that
# is "it changes nothing", not "the recording is better".
#
# Worth being exact about why, because the obvious story is wrong. On a 10 m/200 m
# roller field the recording reports 858 m against a true 999 and the model 704,
# so the recording does look better. But that is a coincidence of two errors
# pointing opposite ways, not information the recording has and the model lacks.
# Measured on the clean surface with no sensor at all: the 30 m GRID loses only 3%
# of that roller field (999 -> 967), while running this same gain pipeline over
# the PERFECT analytic surface loses 20% (999 -> 800), because its own 60 m
# smoothing floor cannot see a 200 m wave either. At 100 m wavelength the split is
# starker: the grid loses 17% (1998 -> 1660) and the pipeline 57% (1998 -> 850).
# The dominant term is this module's smoothing, not the model's resolution. So the
# recording's 858 is 800 of pipeline-limited terrain plus phantom climb that
# happens to back-fill what the smoothing removed.
#
# Which means substitution's ceiling is a limit of THIS CODE more than of the
# data, and it would move if the smoothing floor did. Keeping the recording where
# there is relief is defensible because it is a no-op, and that is the whole of
# the argument.

#: Length of path over which the relief question is asked, in metres.
#:
#: Per-activity is too coarse — a walk half along a flat promenade and half up a
#: hill has to keep its hill, and one verdict for the whole track cannot do that
#: (measured: 452 m reported against a true 300; windowed, 309).
TERRAIN_WINDOW_M = 500.0

#: How much relief a window must show before the recording is trusted, in metres.
#:
#: Measured per 500 m window over every window of all five benchmark seeds, so
#: these ranges are reproducible from the committed fixtures: flat ground reads
#: 0.00, a smoothed path wandering across a 20% slope 0.71-4.20 (pure artefact),
#: a shallow river valley 1.85-2.08, a 1.5% drag 6.95-7.78, and 10 m rollers
#: 8.95-9.98.
#:
#: The valley and the cross-slope artefact OVERLAP, so no threshold separates
#: them. 5 m puts both on the flat side, which is right for the artefact and, as
#: it happens, near-right for the valley too (38.6 m reported against a true 40)
#: because a terrain model is accurate on relief that shallow. Dropping to 2 m to
#: "save" the valley instead lets the artefact back in: 131-190 m across those
#: seeds, against 27-36 m at 5 m.
#:
#: The artefact's 4.20 is closer to this threshold than is comfortable. It is the
#: horizontal-into-vertical coupling term and it grows with the fix quality --
#: at 10 m of horizontal error the artefact alone reports about 114 m.

    """How much the terrain model rises and falls across *window*, in metres.

    A plain range, and the plainness is a measured choice rather than the
    obvious one. Two alternatives were tried against the benchmark and both are
    worse:

    * **Trimming the extreme sample at each end** is wrong on monotonic ground,
      where the extremes ARE the signal: it read a 368 m stretch of a 1.5% drag
      as 4.999 m and called it flat.
    * **Smoothing the model first** was introduced to stop one bad post
      deciding a window, and it blinds the verdict at its own wavelength — 60 m
      of smoothing took a 10 m/100 m roller field from 8.05 m of relief to 3.81
      and substituted the model over real hills. The same trap as the 60 m
      elevation smoothing this whole issue is about.

    Against a PERFECT model the range separates the cases cleanly, and that is
    what the gates assert. Relief per 500 m window, over every window of all
    five benchmark seeds:

    ===============  ==============     ==========  ===========
    should read flat                    should read relief
    ------------------------------     -------------------------
    flat ground      0.00               1.5% drag   6.95 - 7.78
    cross-slope      0.71 - 4.20        rollers     8.95 - 9.98
    shallow valley   1.85 - 2.08
    ===============  ==============     ==========  ===========

    **Give the model its own error and no threshold separates them.** At sigma
    1 m correlated over 500 m the flat group reaches 6.39 (the valley) while the
    relief group falls to 4.38 (the drag) — they overlap, so the verdict is
    unreliable in both directions. This is not a threshold that wants retuning;
    the groups are not ordered.

    What governs it is the error's **correlation length against the window**,
    and the relationship is not monotonic. The drag's no-op survives on 5 of 5
    seeds with a perfect model, 5 of 5 at 60 m, 4 of 5 at 100 m, **1 of 5 at
    200 m**, 2 of 5 at 500 m, and 5 of 5 with independent per-post error. Error
    much shorter than the window averages out inside it; error much longer is a
    constant offset a range cancels; error at the window's own scale is a slope
    that adds to or subtracts from the terrain's. That is the same structure as
    the defect this whole issue is about — sensor drift is inseparable from
    terrain exactly when their correlation lengths match — reappearing one level
    up, which is worth knowing before choosing a window length.

    No statistic tried does better once model error is present: a trimmed range,
    p95-p5, IQR, 2.5 sigma, median-filtered and boxcar ranges at 30-120 m, and
    the summed absolute 30 m step were all measured and none separates the
    groups. Smoothing additionally blinds the verdict at its own wavelength —
    60 m of it took a 10 m/100 m roller field from 8.95 m of relief to 3.99 and
    substituted the model over real hills, the same trap as the 60 m elevation
    smoothing this issue is about. So the plain range ships as the simplest
    thing that is no worse.

    **This is why nothing here is wired to an activity yet.** Unit 2 has to
    measure a real tileset's error correlation at the 500 m scale against known
    terrain; if it sits near the window, this verdict needs rethinking rather
    than retuning, and the window length is the first thing to reconsider. The
    sensitivity is printed by ``python -m tests.elevation_bench`` across all
    five seeds rather than gated — gating a number nobody has measured on real
    tiles would only encode a guess, and quoting one seed of it is how the
    previous version of this docstring came to claim a 0.2 m margin that three
    seeds out of five do not have.
