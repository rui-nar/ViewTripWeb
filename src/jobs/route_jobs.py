"""Durable lifecycle for route-resolution jobs (issue #173, phase D).

A ``DBRouteJob`` row is created when a resolve is requested and advanced to a
terminal status when it finishes. The row — not the queue entry, and not the
segment's ``route_status`` — is the record that work is owed.

That matters because every layer above it can lose the job: RQ without
``appendonly`` loses the queue on a broker restart, a worker killed mid-run
loses whatever it held, and an enqueue that fell back to ``BackgroundTasks``
dies with the API process. Before this, the only component that ever noticed was
the Flutter client's stale-pending recovery — five minutes late, and only if
someone reopened the project.

:func:`sweep_orphaned_jobs` runs at API startup and re-queues anything left
non-terminal.

# The test is one question: run the resolver again on an unchanged segment —
# would it now return a *different* polyline? A new or reordered strategy, a
# change to how the routing graph is built, a fixed member filter (#359/#361):
# yes, bump. Logging, a refactor, a new mirror in the endpoint list, a timeout
# tweak, a release that happens to ship on the same day: no, leave it.
#
# Getting that wrong is not free. A bump makes every rail segment in the
# deployment a candidate, and each one costs a full re-resolve to arrive at a
# byte-identical answer. A stamp that moves every release is a permanent
# re-resolve treadmill against a rate-limited public API.

# the client renders, and the trip's real track is replaced by a line drawn
# between the two endpoints. The segment is then provisional, so the *uncapped*

# The scarce resource is Overpass slot-seconds, not our CPU or wall clock:

# worst.
#
# 3 per hourly run is ~2 minutes of a good hour (3%) and ~15 minutes of a bad
# one (25%), leaving the rest of the single slot to user-triggered resolves and
# to sweep_degraded_segments, which is uncapped per run. It also drains a
# few-hundred-segment deployment over a couple of days rather than in one pass
# — slow is the point, not a compromise: a version bumped by mistake is noticed

# was hard-banned by overpass-api.de in September 2026 for precisely this shape
# of traffic. Under ``RAIL_SOURCE=local`` the cost is disk instead of quota and

    The gap this closes (issue #364): every flag a segment carries records
    whether a resolve *failed*, so a resolve that succeeded and was wrong is
    invisible to every mechanism we have. #359 came back
    ``strategy=relation_endpoints``, ``degraded=False``, 6567 points, a
    plausible 492 km — and started 13.9 km from the station it claimed to leave.
    :func:`sweep_degraded_segments` will never look at that, so #361 fixed the
    resolver and changed nothing for the trips already drawn. Comparing the
    segment's stamp against :data:`RESOLVER_VERSION` is what makes a resolver
    fix reach stored geometry at all.

    Scope and guards, each load bearing:

    * **Rail only.** The stamp tracks the rail resolver's generation, and
      ``api.segments._compute_segment_geometry`` raises ``ValueError`` for a
      flight segment — queueing one would kill a worker, not resolve anything.
    * **No stored geometry, nothing to redo.** ``route_status`` is not enough on
      its own: moving a segment's endpoints (``update_segment``) drops the
      polyline and puts the route back to ``great_circle`` while leaving the
      status at "resolved", so without the ``route_polyline`` check this sweep
      would draw rail track on a segment the user had just reset to a plain arc.
    * **``route_edited`` is skipped, explicitly.** That guard is *not* inherited
      from :func:`sweep_degraded_segments`: the track-edit endpoint clears
      ``route_degraded`` and ``route_hafas_failed``, so a hand-drawn track is
      invisible to that sweep by accident of the flags rather than by a check.
      A stale stamp has no such accident — an edited segment keeps whatever
      version it was last resolved at, normally 0 — so without this line the
      first version bump would silently discard every hand-drawn track in the
      deployment (issue #150).
    * **Already-provisional segments are skipped.** A degraded or HAFAS-fallback
      segment belongs to the other sweep, which will re-resolve it with the new
      resolver and stamp the version as a side effect. Disjoint candidate sets
      mean one segment cannot consume both budgets.
    * **At most :data:`MAX_STALE_RESOLVES_PER_SWEEP` per run** — the arithmetic
      behind the number is with the constant.

    One attempt per segment per version bump, deliberately: the resolve stamps
    the current version on *any* resolved verdict, degraded included, so a
    segment cannot come back for a second try. That choice has a real cost worth
    naming — a re-resolve attempted while every Overpass mirror is unreachable
    replaces good track with a straight chord. It is bounded rather than avoided:
    the result is flagged degraded, shown as such in the UI, and
    :func:`sweep_degraded_segments` then owns it with a fresh
    ``MAX_DEGRADE_RETRIES`` attempts to get real track back. Refusing to write a
    degraded verdict here instead would leave the segment stale forever, re-read
    every hour, and starve the cap with segments that cannot succeed.
