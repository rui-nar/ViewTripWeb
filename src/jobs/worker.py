"""RQ worker entry point — ``python -m src.jobs.worker`` (issue #173).

Run one process per unit of concurrency you want. For the ``resolve`` queue that
count *is* the Overpass politeness bound, so raising it is a deliberate decision
about load on a free public API, not a throughput knob.

The worker deliberately does not run migrations, the APScheduler jobs, or the
admin seed — see ``VIEWTRIP_ROLE`` in ``api/router.py`` for why.

# Backoff between reconnect attempts once REDIS_URL is set but the broker isn't

# leave running.
#
# Previously a single failed probe made the worker exit(1) immediately, and
# `restart: unless-stopped` relaunched it a few seconds later. That is fine for
# a broker that is actually down, but when Redis is merely *slow* — starved by
# whatever else is loading the host — every relaunch itself burns CPU/memory,
# deepening the exact contention that made Redis slow in the first place. Two
# workers doing that in lockstep turned one overloaded host into a ~15s crash
# loop that outlasted the job that triggered it (issue #209). Retrying in place
# costs nothing extra and gives the underlying pressure a chance to clear.

    """RQ callback for a work-horse that died without raising a catchable
    exception — a SIGKILL (almost always the OOM killer) is the common case
    for the memory-heavy ``poster`` queue. Called synchronously by the still-
    alive parent worker process the moment the death is detected, which is
    what makes this the fast path: a poster render is otherwise left
    "running" forever until the next API restart's orphan sweep (see
    ``src.poster.poster_job_runner.sweep_orphaned_poster_jobs``), and the
    user who was promised an email hears nothing in the meantime.

    ``job.args`` is ``(func, *args)`` — every queued job goes through
    ``src.jobs.queue._run_with_level_refresh(func, *args)``, so *func* is the
    real callable regardless of which queue it came from. Only a poster job
    (``run_poster_job``) is handled here: a route job's own resolve failure
    is already recoverable losslessly by the next resolve trigger, and the
    default queue's jobs (share tiles, stats) aren't user-facing durable work.
    Never raises — a broken handler must not take the worker process down.
