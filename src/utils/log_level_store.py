"""Shared copy of the live log-level override, for cross-process propagation
(issue #208).

An admin's live override lives in the API process's memory (see
``src.utils.logging``). That's enough on its own only when the API process
is doing everything — the moment ``REDIS_URL`` is set, route resolution,
poster rendering, share-tile refresh, and stats run in the separate
``src/jobs/worker.py`` process instead (``src/jobs/queue.py``), which never
sees the API process's memory. Redis is already the shared state in that
deployment, so this module mirrors the override there — the worker reads it
once per job (``src.utils.logging.refresh_level_from_store``, called from
``src.jobs.queue.enqueue``'s queued path).

No-Redis deployments (the default, self-hosted case) get no shared copy —
``write``/``clear`` are silent no-ops and ``read`` always returns ``None`` —
which is correct: with no broker there is no separate worker process either,
so the API process's in-memory override is already the whole story.
