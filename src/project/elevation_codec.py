"""Compact encoding for activity elevation profiles (issue #295, Phase 4.2).

A profile is a distance/elevation series, one sample per GPS point. Serialised
as JSON text it costs roughly 20 bytes per sample — and on a 180-day trip the
full details payload it rides in measures **33 MB**, taking ~9 s to fetch and
~5 s to decode on a real device.

The waste is the representation, not the data. Delta + varint over integers is
the same trick Google's polyline encoding already uses for coordinates, and it
is *lossless at the precision the data actually has*:

* distance quantised to 1 m — GPS sample spacing is metres at best
* elevation quantised to 0.1 m — barometric and SRTM sources are within ~1 m

so nothing visible is lost, while consecutive deltas become small integers
that varint packs into one or two bytes instead of twenty.

This deliberately does not downsample. Resolution decisions belong to the
caller (the chart caps itself at 300 points; the map-to-chart cursor wants
more), and folding them into the wire format would make the two impossible to
reason about separately. See docs/PERF_MAP_LOAD.md.

**There are two storage shapes and this module refuses to guess between
them.** ``Activity.elevation_profile`` is ``(distances_km[], elevations_m[])``
— parallel arrays — while ``ProjectIO.to_dict`` hands the REST client a list
of ``[distance, elevation]`` pairs. For a two-sample profile the two shapes
are *structurally identical*: ``([0.0, 0.012], [500.0, 501.5])`` is a valid
pairs list too, and reading it as one turns a 12 m activity into a 500 km one.
An earlier version of this file sniffed the shape and did exactly that, so the
entry points are now explicit and the caller says which it has.
