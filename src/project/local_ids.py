"""Identity for activities the app creates itself (issue #260, unit 2).

Two things live here, and they are separate on purpose:

**Local ids.** ``activity.id`` is a global primary key whose positive range
belongs to Strava — a row's id IS its Strava id, which is what makes an upsert
from a sync idempotent. Anything the app creates itself therefore takes a
NEGATIVE id: a split tail, or a GPX import. Both used to allocate their own way
— a split took ``min(0, global_min) - 1`` and a GPX import a random 62-bit
value — which meant two schemes sharing one keyspace with different collision
properties, and the dense one was unsafe across instances: a ``.viewtrip``
exported from one deployment and imported into another carries its ids with it,
and ids -1, -2, -3 exist in every deployment.

**Source ids.** A content fingerprint of what was imported, so the same file
imported twice is recognised as the same activity rather than silently becoming
two overlapping ones. Distinct from the row id because it answers a different
question: the id says *which row*, the source id says *which real-world thing*.

#: Bits of randomness in a local id. The ceiling is not the database column —
#: that would take 62 — it is JavaScript. The web client is compiled with
#: dart2js, where Dart's ``int`` IS an IEEE-754 double, so an id beyond
#: 2^53 is silently rounded the moment ``jsonDecode`` sees it. The client then
#: sends the rounded value back on every edit, split and delete, and the server
#: answers 404 for an activity that plainly exists on screen.
#:
#: 53 bits keeps every id inside ``Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`` (2^53 - 1), and
#: still leaves the collision probability negligible: n ids collide with odds
#: about n^2 / 2^54, which is one in eighteen million at a million local
#: activities — against the decrementing scheme it replaces, which handed out
#: -1, -2, -3 in every deployment and so collided with certainty once a
#: ``.viewtrip`` crossed between two.
#:
#: Android and iOS carry real 64-bit ints and would not have noticed. The web
#: client is where this bites, and GPX import has been drawing 62-bit ids since
#: it shipped — so this is a fix, not only a precaution.
