"""Retry wrapper for version-checked project saves (issues #172, #173).

Every structural mutation of a project is a load → mutate → compare-and-swap
save, and the CAS loses whenever another writer commits in between. Before this
module there were three inconsistent policies against that same conflict: the
resolve trigger had no retry at all (surfacing a 409 the client never retried),
the resolve job had a bare ``range(2)`` with no backoff, and the crash safety
net could itself lose the race. This is the one place that owns the policy.

The mutation is expressed as a callback so each attempt re-runs it against
*freshly loaded* state — re-applying to a stale object is what silently drops a
concurrent writer's work.
