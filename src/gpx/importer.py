"""GPX import: parse, validate, and read what the file already tells us.

A GPX file carries far more than geometry, and the first version of this import
threw all of it away — it asked the user to type a date, a start time, an end
time and an activity type for a ride they did three weeks ago, while the file
in front of it held every one of those facts. This module reads them.

It also accepts a shape the first version refused. Issue #260 was written for
"a route drawn in Komoot or RideWithGPS", and those planners frequently export
a ``<rte>`` — a planned route — rather than a ``<trk>``. Looking only at
``gpx.tracks`` meant the motivating case came back as "GPX contains no tracks",
which is both a refusal and a lie about why.

Three vocabularies meet here and are deliberately kept apart:

* what the FILE says — ``<trk>``/``<rte>``, ``<name>``, ``<type>``, ``<time>``
* what the IMPORT decides — one chosen candidate, derived times, a mapped type
* what the USER confirms — all of the above, editable, in the preview

This module does the first two and is pure: no HTTP, no database, no clock.

#: Largest upload accepted, checked BEFORE parsing. gpxpy builds an object tree
#: many times the size of the XML — a 4.6 MB file measured at 73 MB of heap — so
#: a point-count limit applied after parsing is a limit that has already let the
#: damage happen. 20 MB is roughly 200k points, comfortably above the point cap
#: below and far below what would trouble the box.
MAX_IMPORT_BYTES = 20 * 1024 * 1024

#: Below this speed the track is not moving: a stop at a café, a wait at a
#: junction, a fix drifting while the phone sits on a table. 0.3 m/s is about a
#: quarter of walking pace.
MOVING_MIN_SPEED_MS = 0.3

#: Speed is measured as NET displacement across this many seconds of track,
#: not between one sample and the next. That distinction is the whole test: a
#: phone sitting still on a table still reports a position that wanders, and at
#: 1 Hz the wander between consecutive samples easily clears 0.3 m. Measured on
#: a twenty-minute stationary recording, a per-sample rule counted 91% of it as
#: moving under half a metre of jitter and 99% under one and a half. Net
#: displacement is what jitter cannot fake, because a random walk goes nowhere:
#: over a 30 s window the same stops measure 0-5%, while a genuine walk at
#: 1.4 m/s still measures 100% moving.
MOVING_WINDOW_S = 30.0

#: A gap longer than this is a pause in the RECORDING rather than a slow stretch
#: of it — the device was switched off, or lost its fix in a tunnel. Counting it
#: would hand a two-hour lunch to the ride's moving time.
MAX_SAMPLE_GAP_S = 300

#: GPX ``<type>`` is free text and every tool writes it differently. Mapped into
#: the types the app draws and colours; anything unrecognised stays None so the
#: user picks, rather than being handed a confident wrong answer.
