"""Pure translation of provider webhook events into subscription state (#121).

No SDK, no network, no database — a dict in, a :class:`SubscriptionUpdate` (or
``None``) out. That is what makes the interesting parts of billing testable:
every rule about which event grants what, and every defensive read of a payload
shape that Stripe has changed over the years, is exercised from a recorded JSON
fixture in the test suite.

Ordering and replay are the caller's job (see :mod:`api.billing`): Stripe
retries deliveries and does not guarantee order, so each update carries the
event id and timestamp needed to reject a duplicate or an out-of-date event.
