"""What a given user is allowed to do (issue #121).

The rule that shapes this module: **billing is off unless it is switched on**.
ViewTrip ships as a public MIT Docker image, and a self-hoster must never meet a
paywall — so with no provider configured, ``billing_enabled()`` is False,
everyone is on the strongest plan, and no limit is ever checked.

Layering:
  * :func:`plan_from_subscription` and :func:`plans.over_quota` are pure — the
    interesting rules are testable without a database.
  * :func:`plan_for` and the ``ensure_*`` helpers do the DB reads and raise
    :class:`~src.exceptions.errors.QuotaExceeded`, which the app maps to 402.
