"""Per-user storage accounting for quota checks (issue #121).

The admin dashboard measures storage by walking the filesystem
(:func:`src.admin.storage.dir_size`). That is the right tool there — exact, no
state to drift — and the wrong one on an upload path, where it would add a
multi-second tree walk to every photo.

So writes keep a running counter instead: each save adds the bytes it wrote,
each delete subtracts the bytes it removed, and a nightly job re-walks the tree
and corrects any drift (a crash between write and increment, files removed out
of band). The counter is therefore *approximately* right within a day and
exactly right after each reconcile — good enough to gate an upload on, which is
all it is for. The dashboard keeps using the walk.
