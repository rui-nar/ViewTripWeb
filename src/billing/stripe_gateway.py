The only module in the codebase that imports the Stripe SDK, and it does so
lazily so a self-hosted instance never touches it.

Kept deliberately thin: it creates sessions and verifies signatures, and does
not interpret anything. Interpretation lives in
:mod:`src.billing.webhook_events`, where it can be tested against recorded
payloads without a network or an API key.
