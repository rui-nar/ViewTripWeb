"""Digital Asset Links statement for Android App Links (issue #136).

This one small JSON file is the whole difference between a share link opening in
the app and opening in a browser. It is also easy to break without noticing: the
SPA catch-all route answers *every* unmatched path with index.html, so a
mis-registered route here returns HTML with a 200 and Android just records a
failed verification.

Exercised against the real ``api.router.app`` — route ordering is the point.
