"""Store schema 2: member roles, ordered stop nodes, and reading a schema 1 file (#359).

Schema 2 adds two things and drops none:

* ``relation_way.role`` — without it the resolver cannot tell a route's path
  from a platform it merely touches, which is issue #359;
* ``relation_node`` — every node member in member order, which is what a
  relation calls at and in what sequence. Nothing reads it yet, deliberately;
  it is here because adding it later costs a rebuild of all 49 regions and
  adding it during this bump costs nothing.

The third thing under test is the *absence* of a cutover: a reader that accepts
only its own schema turns every bump into an Overpass outage, whichever order
code and data ship in.
