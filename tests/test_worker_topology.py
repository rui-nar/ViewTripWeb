"""The shipped compose file must realise the queue bounds code declares (#188).

An RQ worker takes one job at a time, so a queue's concurrency is the number of
worker processes listening on it — a fact that lives entirely in the deployment
file, while the bounds it has to satisfy are documented in ``src/jobs/queue.py``.
Nothing at runtime spans the two, which is how both workers ended up consuming
``poster`` at ``replicas: 2`` despite the queue being documented as "keep it to
one". These tests are that missing link.

They read ``docker-compose.yml.example`` rather than the real
``docker-compose.yml``, which is gitignored and per-host. The example is the
thing a new deployment is copied from, so it is the one that has to be right.
