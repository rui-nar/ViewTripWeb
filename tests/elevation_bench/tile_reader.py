"""Elevation from the AWS Open Data terrarium tileset (issue #386, unit 2).

**Measurement tooling, not production code.** It was written as the production
reader for the flatness oracle in
:func:`src.models.track_edit.terrain_corrected_gain`, and the measurement it
enabled — ``terrarium_measure.py`` beside it — found that no commercially usable
global terrain model is accurate enough for that oracle to fire reliably. With
nothing in the application ever going to call it, keeping it under ``src/``
would be speculative code. It lives here so the measurement stays reproducible,
and so it is ready if the question is ever reopened with better data.

It reads the Mapzen/AWS "terrain tiles" in terrarium encoding: plain
``{z}/{x}/{y}.png`` on a public S3 bucket, no token, open licence with
attribution, and safe to cache on disk because terrain does not change. Nothing
here decides whether that elevation is GOOD enough — that is the measurement's
job. This only has to return the tileset's value at a coordinate, the same way
every time.

Three things are easy to get wrong and are pinned by tests:

**Half a pixel.** Pixel ``(i, j)`` of a Web Mercator tile covers global pixel
space ``[i, i+1)``, so its VALUE sits at ``i + 0.5``. Interpolating between
pixel corners instead of pixel centres shifts every sample by half a pixel —
about 6 m at zoom 13 and 52 degrees north — which is an invented bias the
moment it is compared against anything else.

**Tile edges.** The four samples a bilinear read needs can straddle two or four
tiles. A read that only looks inside one tile either clamps at the edge or
indexes past it.

**"No data" versus "not now".** A tile that does not exist (404) is a normal
state — open ocean, the poles — and remembering that saves asking again. A
tile the server failed to send (5xx, timeout) is NOT absent, and remembering
THAT would blind the reader to a whole tile permanently because S3 hiccupped
once. The two must never share a cache entry.
