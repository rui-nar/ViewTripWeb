"""Measure global terrain models against 1 m lidar, for the #386 oracle.

    python -m tests.elevation_bench.terrarium_measure [--models terrarium copernicus gedtm]

Not a test, and not collected by pytest: it downloads ~20 MB per lidar tile,
a Copernicus tile and a few hundred terrarium tiles, and needs numpy (and
rasterio for GEDTM30), neither of which the application depends on. It exists so
the verdict on terrain substitution is a number anyone can re-derive rather than
a figure quoted from a transcript.

What it measures, and what it deliberately does not
--------------------------------------------------
The flatness oracle (:func:`src.models.track_edit.terrain_corrected_gain`) asks
one question per 500 m of path: does the terrain model show relief here? Its two
wrong answers are NOT symmetric, and the first version of this measurement
treated them as if they were:

* **Flat ground read as relief** keeps the recording. That is today's behaviour:
  the phantom climb is not removed, and nothing is made worse. A **missed fix**.
* **Relief read as flat** swaps the model in over a real hill. That can erase
  climb that happened. **Harm.**

Counting both as "misreads" made a missed fix look like a failure: the headline
"26 of 26 flat windows misread" in a city was entirely the harmless kind. But
"relief read as flat" is not the only harm either. On a recording that did not
need correcting, ANY substitution replaces good data with the model's own error,
in either direction. So the primary output here is the **outcome** — what the
shipped oracle reports end to end against the truth, for recordings of every
quality, in metres per kilometre — with the per-window verdicts kept as a
diagnostic and their two kinds named for what they are.

Ground truth
------------
Berlin's DGM1: airborne lidar, BARE EARTH, 1 m grid, licensed dl-de/zero-2-0,
https://gdi.berlin.de/data/dgm1/atom/. The sites separate causes that a flat
test would conflate:

* **Tempelhofer Feld**, **Tegel airfield** — flat open ground. Transects are
  confined to rectangles inside each airfield. An earlier version used a whole
  2 km lidar tile at Tempelhof and called it "open, no buildings, no trees"; most
  of that tile is streets, houses and the Ringbahn. Two airfields rather than
  one, because a single site's figure is a handful of independent 500 m patches.
  Both are still Berlin, on one Copernicus tile.
* **Luebars** — MIXED rural ground: by OpenStreetMap land use about a quarter
  fields and meadow, a third village and allotments, a quarter wood and wetland.
  Not "rolling farmland"; its lines that are mostly field fare no better.
* **Mitte** — flat ground under a dense city.
* **Grunewald** — flat-ish ground under forest.
* **Teufelsberg**, **Mueggelberge** — real relief.

"Truth" for a gain is the gain pipeline applied to the lidar itself, so every
figure is compared like for like and the pipeline's own smoothing floor cancels.
A line with any gap in the lidar (a site's edge at the Berlin border) is dropped,
and the report says how many.

The recording
-------------
The oracle never sees a perfect path. Each transect is recorded with AR(1)
vertical drift, optional white noise, and AR(1) horizontal drift on a fixed
60 s scale (the path comes from GPS whatever the altimeter is), smoothed over
100 m of ground before the model is read. Five recording classes, from a
drifting phone to a clean track, four seeds each — see :data:`RECORDINGS`.

"Worse" is counted per LINE, not per line and seed: the four seeds share a
line's terrain, and a line's terrain explains five to ten times more of the
spread than its seed does, so line x seed counts overstate how many independent
cases agree.
