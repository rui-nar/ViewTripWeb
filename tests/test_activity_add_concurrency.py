"""Regression tests for the add_activities lost-write race (mutation-propagation
audit, api/activities.py).

``add_activities`` used to load a project snapshot, mutate it in memory, and
call ``save_project`` with the default ``check_version=False`` — a blind
full-item-list replace. A concurrent writer (another ``add_activities`` call,
a ``split_activity``, a point-edit) that loaded the project *after* this
snapshot was taken but committed *before* this call's save landed had its own
committed changes silently overwritten: no error, no 409, the data was just
gone.

The fix retrofits ``add_activities`` onto ``save_project_with_retry``
(src/project/repo_retry.py) — the load→mutate→``check_version=True``→retry
pattern already used by api/project_items.py — so a version conflict is
caught and retried against freshly reloaded state instead of silently
clobbering it.

The interleaving below is pinned deterministically (a monkeypatch on
``Project.add_activities`` injects the "concurrent write" between this
request's load and its save) rather than raced with threads — same technique
as ``tests/test_item_write_granularity.py``. The ordering is what matters,
not the concurrency primitive.
