"""DELETE /{name}/activities/{id}/local must be scoped to the project (#405).

``ActivityMixin.delete_local_activity`` validated that the id was local and
that the row existed, but never that the row belonged to the project the call
named. The route's permission check proves you may edit *that* project — so an
editor of trip B could delete trip A's local activity, bump trip B's
lock_version, and leave trip A with an item pointing at a missing row.

The fix tests "no OTHER project references this row" rather than "this project
references it", which deliberately lets an ORPHANED local row through. Two
tests here exist to make that asymmetry load-bearing, so the inverted,
"simpler" check fails instead of quietly breaking things:

  * ``test_orphaned_local_row_is_deletable`` — the state migration
    ``d5b1c0a2e3f4`` documents must stay reachable from the API.
  * ``test_deleting_the_timeline_item_still_removes_the_local_row`` — the
    timeline path commits the item removal BEFORE calling the repo, so the row
    it asks us to delete is always unreferenced.
