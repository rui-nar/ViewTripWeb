"""Rail geometry read from local region stores (#345, Phase 3).

The phase substitutes the data source and changes nothing else, so the central
test here is parity: each strategy, run against a store built from the fixture
extract, returns the *same polyline* it returns against an Overpass response
carrying the same data. ``FixtureOverpass`` is that response — it answers the
resolver's real queries out of the fixture's tables with Overpass's own
semantics (a metric ``around:`` circle, a way selected by having a node inside
the bounding box), deliberately not by calling the reader under test.

Stores are real, built by ``src.rail.builder`` from real and synthetic extracts.
Only the network is mocked, because the network is the only thing this phase is
allowed to stop using.
