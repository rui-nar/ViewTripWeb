"""The backfill sweep for prepared activity geometry — issue #369 stage B2.

Activities written since #369 get their prepared blob beside the polyline. Ones
that predate it have no row and would otherwise be prepared lazily on a user's
first open of the trip — correct, but it means the first open still pays the
cost the change exists to remove. This sweep drains that backlog in the
background.

What these pin is that it is *bounded*, *terminates*, *skips what it cannot
prepare*, and — the one that matters most — that it cannot overwrite a writer
that landed while it was preparing.
