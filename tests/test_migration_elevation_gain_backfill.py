"""Data-migration test for b7f1a3c9d204 — recompute inflated elevation gain.

Builds a throwaway SQLite DB up to the revision *before* the backfill, seeds
activities covering every case the migration distinguishes, runs it, and asserts
who was corrected and who was left alone. Hermetic — never touches the
developer's real db.

The case that matters most is the encrypted one: `total_elevation_gain` is a
plain column, but the profile it must be recomputed from can be a client-side
E2EE envelope the server cannot decrypt. Those rows must come through untouched
rather than be zeroed or crash the migration (issue #260, follow-up #366).
