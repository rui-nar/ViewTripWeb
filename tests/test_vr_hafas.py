"""Tests for the two-endpoint train route-relation strategy in overpass_service.

Originally also covered the VR (Finnish Railways) HAFAS backend; that backend
was removed in issue #277 when train lookups moved to MOTIS/Transitous, which
indexes the same ``fi-digitraffic`` data. Finnish coverage now lives in
``test_motis_train_route.py::TestFinlandViaTheSameIndex``. Everything here is
about the Overpass geometry fallback, which trains only reach when no train
number is given or none could be matched.
