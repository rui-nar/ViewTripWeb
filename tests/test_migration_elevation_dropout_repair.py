"""Data-migration test for c4a9e1f70b38 — repair the 0.0 missing-<ele> sentinel.

Builds a throwaway SQLite DB up to the revision *before* the repair, seeds the
cases it distinguishes, runs it, and asserts who was repaired and who was left
alone. Hermetic — never touches the developer's real db.

The case that matters most is the genuine sea-level one: the sentinel is
detected by shape, not by a flag, so a coastal track whose real readings include
0.0 must come through untouched. The E2EE case matters for the same reason it
did in test_migration_elevation_gain_backfill: the profile these rows must be
repaired FROM is ciphertext the server holds no key for (issue #374, #366).
