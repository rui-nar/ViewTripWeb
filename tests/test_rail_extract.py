"""The rail extract's tag selection and manifest (issue #345, phase 1).

The filter decides what route resolution can see. Widen it and unconnected
sidings enter the graph, which the spike showed *breaks* routes that work
today; narrow it and strategies stop finding things Overpass finds. Neither
failure is visible in any other test — the artifact is built monthly in CI, and
by the time a wrong selection shows up it is a wrong polyline on a user's trip.
The contract itself was wrong once (#349) and nothing caught it, which is what
these assertions exist for.

So the selection is pinned against a checked-in extract with known contents:
two 900 m boxes in Mannheim — one over the ARENA/Maimarkt halt, one over
Neuostheim — cut from Germany's Geofabrik extract with ``osmium extract`` and
joined with ``osmium merge`` (OpenStreetMap data, ODbL). Two boxes rather than
one because the dense kilometre between them costs 600 KB and decides nothing;
this way the fixture is 420 KB and still holds one of everything the filter has
to rule on:

- 12 ``railway=rail`` and 27 ``narrow_gauge`` ways to keep, against 152
  service-tagged ones to drop and 49 trams, 12 platforms and a signal box
  besides;
- one ``railway=light_rail`` way and one ``route=light_rail`` relation, which
  are **synthetic** (ids 9000000000001-9000000000004, a 200 m line inside the
  box): Mannheim maps its Stadtbahn as tram and narrow_gauge, so the box held
  no ``light_rail`` at all and the only thing asserting that value was a
  hand-written table restating the constant it was meant to guard. Dropping
  ``light_rail`` from either constant passed 83 tests. It now fails on the
  filter's own output. The way is in no relation and the relation's member is a
  real ``railway=rail`` way, so neither is kept by the other's row — drop
  either value and its element leaves the file;
- 11 nodes carrying ``uic_ref`` that are *not* tagged as stations — tram stops,
  a bus stop, ``public_transport=stop_position`` — which is the row #349
  corrected and the reason strategy A can find a relation at all;
- a station mapped as a way (ARENA/Maimarkt) and one mapped as a relation
  (Neuostheim), neither of which the old node-only contract could see;
- ``route=train`` and ``route=railway`` relations to keep, against trams,
  buses, cycle routes, a pipeline and a waterway to drop;
- relations whose members include four sidings and three platforms, so the
  member-way closure — geometry Overpass's ``out geom`` returns and this
  extract must too — is exercised rather than assumed.

The expected counts below are therefore not magic numbers: changing the
selection changes them, which is the point. The counts under "the fixture is
worth testing against" are the other half — a widened filter can make an
assertion pass vacuously, and those keep each row of the contract represented.

``rail_mannheim_filtered.osm.pbf`` beside it is this box put through the
filter: the selection's expected output, checked in so that a change to what is
selected has to be shown in a diff rather than only in a count.
