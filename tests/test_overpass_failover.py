"""Tests for _overpass transport: how it paces, waits and fails over.

Regression cover for the 2026-09-06 incident. Overpass-api.de was healthy the
whole time — it answered a full 5.2 MB strategy-C query in 8.4s with both slots
free — but every rail resolve came back degraded after 213-316s, against a
client that gives up at 120s. The transport treated a 429 ("busy, come back in
a moment") exactly like a dead host and immediately failed over to two mirrors
that cost the full 45s socket timeout each, roughly 90s per query. It then
reported only the *last* error, so the logs named a mirror and never revealed
that the primary had been reached at all.
