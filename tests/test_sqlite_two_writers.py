"""SQLite under two writing processes (issue #173, phase B2).

Until the worker container existed, one process owned every write. A queued job
runs in a *different* OS process against the same SQLite file, so two engines
now write concurrently — the situation `busy_timeout` and WAL exist for, but
which nothing previously exercised.

The existing suites cover adjacent ground: `test_sqlite_pragmas` checks the
PRAGMAs are applied per connection, `test_track_save_db_lock` covers contention
*within* one engine. Neither creates a second engine, which is what a second
process actually is.

Uses file-backed SQLite deliberately — `:memory:` gives each engine its own
private database, so a two-writer test against it would pass while proving
nothing.
