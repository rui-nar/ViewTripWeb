"""Zoom level of detail for map geometry — issue #295.

The measurement behind it: a 219-activity trip carries 1,465,345 coordinates
and the map renders 6,051 of them, holding the rest as roughly 180 MB of Dart
heap on a device whose heap plateaus at ~625 MB and which is killed above
~1.3 GB. Simplifying to what a zoom can actually resolve removes the
difference, rather than decimating it away client-side after paying to
transfer and materialise it.

# ── The track cache (issue #338) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The unit of caching is the line, not the level. These pin the parts X-Cache
# cannot see: that a trip too large to cache is refused and logged rather than
# silently rebuilt forever; that a bust drops the entry directly, which is what
# still holds when the shared Redis generation bump is lost; that eviction is
# least-recently-used; that memoised results stay inside their budget; and,
# above all, that simplifying from the cached working set gives exactly what
# simplifying from the original gave, since that equivalence is the whole
# safety argument for keeping the working set instead of the track.
