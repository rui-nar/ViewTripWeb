"""A load-mutate-save that blind-overwrites loses a concurrent writer's work.

`save_project` with the default `check_version=False` rewrites *every* field of
the project row from the in-memory snapshot the caller loaded — day-meta,
sleeping options, counters, track style, trip dates. So any write that commits
between that load and the save is silently reverted to its pre-request value,
with no error on either side.

Two importers still did this: the GPX import and the Strava sync. The Strava
one is the worst window in the app, since a network round trip to Strava sits
inside it. `save_project_with_retry` reloads and re-applies the mutation under
the optimistic lock instead — the policy every other structural mutation
already used (issues #172/#173).

These tests drive the real endpoints and land a real concurrent write inside
the window, by hooking the repo call the endpoint makes mid-request.

    under test would be fake.

    Only `db_module.engine` is patched, never `get_session`. Patching the
    factory was what made an earlier version of this file mis-route writes
    between tests: the routers are imported lazily below, so the first import
    ran `from models.db import get_session` while the patch was live and bound
    *that* test's lambda — and with it that test's engine — permanently into
    the router module. The second test's PUT then wrote to the first test's
    database and the race quietly stopped happening. The real `get_session`
    reads the `engine` global at call time, so patching the engine alone is
    both sufficient and stable. (Nothing in api/ binds a factory on its own;
