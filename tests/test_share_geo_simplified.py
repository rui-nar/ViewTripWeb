"""Zoom level of detail for share links — issue #321.

The zoom LOD of #295 landed for the owner path only. Everyone opening a public
or shared link still got the full-resolution geometry it exists to avoid: on
the trip it was measured against, 1,465,345 coordinates and a 4.5 MB payload
against the owner's 13,273 and 448 KB, holding roughly 180 MB of Dart heap —
on the device least likely to have room for it, since a public link is the path
most often opened on a phone the owner has never seen.

``GET /api/share/{token}/geo/simplified`` closes that, keyed on the owner so it
shares every cache entry — and every bust — with the owner route. What these
pin is the part that is not just "call the same helper":

* the two builders agreed *before* one cache key was allowed to serve both;
* the project is read fresh from the DB, not from the 60 s per-token cache;
* the token is resolved before any cache is read;
* no ``aid`` reaches the key, and no visit is recorded.
