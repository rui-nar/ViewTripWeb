"""Rate-limit-aware retry for background activity enrichment (mutation-
propagation audit fix).

``_enrich_activities_background`` is the live path `add_activities` schedules
after every import. Before this fix it had no rate-limit awareness at all —
each ``get_activity_streams`` call blocked on the shared limiter for up to
``MAX_WAIT_SECONDS`` before raising, one activity at a time. These tests pin:

  1. a ``RateLimitError`` mid-batch defers the rest of the batch instead of
     dropping it, and the deferred activities are retried (and this time
     succeed) once the window is said to have reset;
  2. a quota that's already nearly exhausted is noticed *before* the next
     Strava call (no per-activity blocking wait).
