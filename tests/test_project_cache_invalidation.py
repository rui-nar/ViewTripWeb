"""Every mutating project route must invalidate the project payload cache.

``GET /{name}/meta`` is served from a cache (issue #178), so a route that changes
what it returns without busting leaves the activity panel showing pre-edit
content until the TTL expires — a staleness bug strictly worse than the slow
load the cache exists to fix.

This walks the real router table rather than trusting a checklist: a route added
next year lands here automatically. The check is a source scan for one of the
bust helpers, which is coarse by design — it cannot prove the bust runs on every
branch, only that the route knows it has to. Routes that legitimately don't
touch project payloads are listed in ``_EXEMPT`` with the reason.
