"""The /meta payload cache (issue #178).

``GET /api/projects/{name}/meta`` is what the activity panel blocks on at load
and what the client polls every few seconds while a re-fetch or a route resolve
is pending; on a large project a cold load measured 11-13 s, most of the
client's 30 s budget. It now rides the same per-project byte cache as the
full-res geo payload, which brings two things that must be proven here: it is
keyed per *caller* (journal entries and caller_role differ per member), and it
is invalidated by writes rather than only by its TTL.

Cache mechanics shared with geo (generation guard, TTL, cross-process busts)
are covered by test_geo_cache_staleness.py / test_geo_cache_cross_process.py.
