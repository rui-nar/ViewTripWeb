    The Flutter client fires many requests in parallel when opening a project
    (meta, geo, stats, activities, photos …). SQLAlchemy's default QueuePool
    (size 5 + 10 overflow = 15 total) is far too small: a couple of concurrent
    users exhaust it, then every new request blocks for ``pool_timeout`` seconds
    waiting for a connection — so the app looks completely hung and needs a
    manual restart (issue #35). SQLite in WAL mode serves many concurrent readers
    fine, so we raise the ceiling well above realistic load and fail fast if it
    is ever hit. In-memory SQLite (tests) uses a non-queue pool that rejects
    these kwargs, so they are only applied to file-backed / networked DBs.

    Without this, SQLite runs with journal_mode=DELETE (writers block all
    readers) and busy_timeout=0 — so the moment two operations contend (e.g. a
    Polarsteps import firing parallel create_memory writes plus background photo
    downloads), it raises "database is locked" instead of waiting. On every new
    connection we set:

      * busy_timeout=30000  — wait up to 30s for a lock rather than erroring
        immediately. The single biggest win; safe on every filesystem.
      * journal_mode=WAL    — readers no longer block on the writer. Persisted in
        the DB header; safe on local filesystems (incl. Btrfs).
      * synchronous=NORMAL  — the standard, durable-enough pairing with WAL.
      * wal_autocheckpoint=0 — disable SQLite's default *inline* checkpoint
        (which runs synchronously inside whichever commit happens to push the
        WAL past ~1000 pages). On slow storage that checkpoint's I/O can take
        seconds, and since it runs inside that connection's commit, it holds the
        single SQLite write lock for the whole thing — any other writer queued
        behind it burns its busy_timeout waiting on an unlucky commit instead of
        real contention. ``checkpoint_wal()`` below replaces it with a periodic
        PASSIVE checkpoint that never blocks a writer.
