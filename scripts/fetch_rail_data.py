"""Install the published rail extracts into RAIL_DATA_DIR (issue #345, delivery).

Phase 1 builds rail-only country extracts in CI and publishes them as assets on
a prerelease tagged ``rail-data-<YYYY-MM-DD>``. Phase 2 turns one of those into
the per-region SQLite store ``src/rail/store.py`` reads. Phase 3 reads the
stores when ``RAIL_SOURCE=local``. Nothing put the data on the box: this does.

Run it on the box, by hand or from whatever schedules it, never at container
boot — see docs/DEPLOYMENT_VPS.md, "Rail data".

    python scripts/fetch_rail_data.py --dest /app/data/rail

**It fetches the extract and builds the store here rather than downloading a
prebuilt store**, because the release holds extracts and only extracts. The
build is affordable — Germany, the largest region, is ~12 s and ~200 MB peak —
and the extract is a fraction of the size of the store it produces — Germany
10 MB against 58 MB, a sixth; Luxembourg, measured on the real published
asset, 0.33 MB against 1.36 MB, a quarter — so building locally moves *less*
over the network, not more. ``osmium`` is already in requirements.txt and
therefore already in the image.

Four properties, in the order they matter:

1. **A store is moved into place with :func:`os.replace` and never written
   where a reader can see it half-written.** ``src/services/rail_source.py``
   guards *opening* a store, not querying one, so a ``sqlite3.DatabaseError``
   raised on a connection a worker already holds escapes into the RQ job
   (issue #352, finding 2). Overwriting a file in place while a worker has it
   open is the one way to cause that. A rename leaves the old inode alive for
   every open handle, so the failure cannot happen — which is why the work
   directory lives *inside* the destination, on the same filesystem: a rename
   across filesystems is a copy, and a copy is not atomic.
2. **Every asset is checked against the manifest's sha256 and byte count
   before it is built from**, and a region that fails leaves whatever is
   already installed exactly where it is.
3. **Re-running converges.** A region whose store was installed from this
   manifest's checksum *by this store schema* is skipped, so a run interrupted
   after 30 of 49 regions costs 19 regions the second time, not 49 — while a
   schema bump, which leaves the extract byte-identical, rebuilds all 49
   instead of skipping them as up to date.
4. **Bounded.** One region's extract plus the store built from it, and the
   extract is deleted the moment the store exists. Nothing accumulates: the
   VPS has 40 GB for two whole stacks.
5. **One refresh at a time.** Two overlapping runs are the one way this step
   can publish a corrupt store, and the sidecar would then make it permanent
   — see :func:`_staging`, which holds the lock and hands out this run's own
   staging directory.

The record of what is installed is a sidecar ``<store>.sha256`` beside each
store, written *after* the rename, holding ``<asset digest> <store schema>``.
The store itself cannot carry it — the builder's ``meta`` records the source
file's name and date but not its digest, and the builder is not this step's to
change. Both fields are part of the key: see :func:`installed_build` for why a
digest alone turns a schema bump into a refresh that silently does not happen.
