"""Provision the Stripe product/price catalogue for the paid tiers (issue #121).

The dashboard can do this in a few clicks, which is exactly the problem: those
clicks are unrecorded, unrepeatable, and have to be performed twice — once in
test mode and once in live. The three `price_...` ids they produce are what
`STRIPE_PRICE_TIER_1..3` point at, and a wrong one silently grants Tier 1
(see docs/BILLING.md). So the catalogue is declared here and applied by running
this, against either mode, as many times as you like.

**Names and descriptions are not written here.** They come from
`src.billing.plans`, the same module the server enforces and the pricing UI
renders, so a Stripe product can never advertise limits the server does not
grant. Only the amounts live in this file — Stripe is the one place that has to
know what to charge.

It also provisions the **customer portal configuration**, because
`POST /api/billing/change-plan` (issue #153) is only as correct as that is: the
in-app tier switch opens a portal flow, and the flow refuses a price the
configuration does not list. Declaring it here is what makes "a downgrade takes
effect at the end of the paid period" a fact in the repository rather than a
setting somebody remembers toggling.

Idempotency has three handles:

* **Products** use a caller-supplied id (`traxjourney_tier_1`), so re-running
  updates the existing product rather than creating a second one.
* **Prices** use a `lookup_key`. A price's amount, currency and interval are
  **immutable** in Stripe — repricing is not an edit. So when an amount changes
  this creates a *new* price, moves the lookup key onto it
  (`transfer_lookup_key`), and archives the old one. Subscriptions already on
  the old price keep paying the old amount; Stripe does not re-price anyone
  behind your back, and neither does this script.
* **The portal configuration** carries `metadata.managed_by`, since Stripe
  assigns its id — the run finds its own configuration by that mark instead of
  creating another one each time.

Dry run by default — it prints what it would do and touches nothing. Pass
``--apply`` to write, and additionally ``--live`` if the key is a live one:
building a live catalogue from guessed numbers leaves archived prices you can
never delete.

    export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
    python scripts/stripe_catalog.py                # show the plan
    python scripts/stripe_catalog.py --apply        # create/update
    python scripts/stripe_catalog.py --apply --live # against sk_live_...

On success it prints the `STRIPE_PRICE_TIER_*` block to copy into the
environment.
