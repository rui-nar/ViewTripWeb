"""Build a rail-only OSM extract for one region (issue #345, phase 1).

Route resolution needs four things from OpenStreetMap: railway ways, route
relations, the nodes a UIC code can be looked up on, and stations. Overpass
answers those over the network today, and the answers are large enough that
fair use bans us. The same data, filtered out of a Geofabrik country extract,
is three orders of magnitude smaller: Denmark 494 MB -> 0.8 MB, Germany
4.83 GB -> ~25 MB.

**The raw extracts must never reach the server, the repo, or an image.** Europe
raw is 34.9 GB and the VPS has 40 GB total. So this script runs in CI, on a
throwaway runner: download, filter, publish the small result, delete the rest.
It removes the source and the intermediate as soon as each is consumed rather
than at the end, so peak disk stays near one raw extract.

Two steps, in that order for a reason:

1. ``osmium tags-filter`` (C++) does the pass over the raw file. A pyosmium
   pass with a per-object Python callback measured 2,022 s for Germany in the
   spike; the CLI does the same reduction in a couple of minutes. But
   tags-filter can only OR tag patterns together — it cannot express "railway
   ways *without* a service tag" or "station *and* uic_ref" — so it can only
   over-select.
2. A pyosmium pass applies the exact selection, and is cheap because it runs
   over step 1's output (Denmark: 1 MB) rather than the raw extract.

The selection must match what src/services/overpass_service.py asks Overpass
for today, element for element. Anything else changes route results for reasons
unrelated to moving the data source, which is the one thing this migration must
not do. It is spelled out below against the queries themselves, because the
plan's summary of them was wrong once already (#349) and a filter that is
quietly too narrow looks exactly like one that works.

Usage:

    python scripts/build_rail_extract.py regions --json
    python scripts/build_rail_extract.py build europe/denmark --out-dir dist
    python scripts/build_rail_extract.py manifest --out-dir dist \
        --base released/manifest.json --expect '["europe/denmark"]'

``regions`` needs PyYAML alone — the workflow's plan job installs nothing else.

Requires the ``osmium`` CLI (Debian/Ubuntu: ``apt-get install osmium-tool``).
