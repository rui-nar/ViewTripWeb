"""Backfill correct photo order for memories scrambled by the issue #237 race.

Before that fix (see api/memories.py's ``_write_memory_photo`` and
api/photo_locks.py), Polarsteps import fired every photo of a step as a
concurrent background download with no ordering info sent to the server, so
``photos_json`` ended up in whatever order the downloads happened to
complete — not Polarsteps' original order. New imports are fixed; this
script repairs memories imported *before* the fix.

It can still recover the original order because ``_save_photo_files`` always
wrote the full-resolution file to disk byte-for-byte unmodified (only the
thumbnail is re-encoded) — so re-downloading a step's photos from Polarsteps
and content-hashing them against the locally stored full-res files recovers
which local UUID belongs at which position, even though the order they're
currently stored in is wrong.

For each project with Polarsteps-imported memories, the source trip is
resolved from ``projectsyncmeta.linked_ps_trip_id`` (set when the project is
linked for auto-sync), or from an explicit ``--project-trip
PROJECT_ID:TRIP_ID`` override for projects that were imported once and never
linked. The owner's Polarsteps session is the ``remember_token`` already
stored in ``polarstepstoken`` (see scripts/inspect_polarsteps_steps.py) — no
credentials need to be supplied.

A memory is left untouched (flagged for manual review, not guessed at) when
too many of its source downloads fail or too few of its local photos match
any source photo by content — that usually means the trip changed on
Polarsteps since import, not that this script's logic is wrong.

DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT — prints the plan and changes nothing. Pass --apply to write.
Always run against a copy first.

Usage:
    python scripts/reorder_polarsteps_memory_photos.py --db "viewtripweb.db" --data-dir data
    python scripts/reorder_polarsteps_memory_photos.py --db copy.db --data-dir data --apply

    # a project that was imported once and never linked for auto-sync needs
