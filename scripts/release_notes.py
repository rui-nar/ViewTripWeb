"""Generate user-facing release notes for a commit range.

The release script used to paste `git log --pretty=format:- %s` under a
"What's changed" heading. For v0.46.9 that produced five bullets for two real
changes: three were merge commits, and the two that mattered were written in
commit grammar (``fix(people): ...``) rather than anything a user would read.

This module turns the same range into grouped, linked, audience-separated
notes. Three layers, each degrading to the one below:

1. **Parsing** — drop merges and version bumps, read Conventional Commit
   prefixes, group by type, map the scope to a user-facing area.
2. **Trailers** — a ``Release-Note:`` trailer in the commit body wins over the
   subject line. No parser can turn "enforce the API quota process-wide" into a
   user benefit; only the author knows that, so this is where they write it.
3. **Polish** (``--polish``) — asks Claude to translate any entry that isn't in
   English and to write a short intro paragraph. Entirely optional: no API key,
   no network, or any error means the notes are rendered without it. Whether or
   not it runs, non-English entries are reported on stderr.

Standalone use, to preview any range without cutting a release::
