# Application metrics

Prometheus instrumentation for the FastAPI server (issue #125). Covers HTTP
traffic, authentication, third-party APIs, background jobs and the database.

## Enabling the endpoint

Set `METRICS_TOKEN` in the server's **runtime** environment (a compose
`environment:`/`env_file:` entry — not a `docker build` arg, which never
reaches the running process):

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Then `docker compose up -d` to recreate the container (a plain `restart` does
not apply env changes).

- **Unset** → `GET /metrics` returns **404**. The endpoint is off, and a probe
  can't tell it apart from a route that was never deployed.
- **Set** → `GET /metrics` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and returns
  the Prometheus text exposition format. A wrong or missing header is a 401.

The token is checked on every request, so metrics can be switched on for a
running deployment without rebuilding the image.

Why a token at all: Caddy reverse-proxies *every* path of `traxjourney.com` to
the app (`docs/DEPLOYMENT_VPS.md`), so an unauthenticated `/metrics` would
publish user counts, route names, error rates and DB size to anyone who asks.

## Scraping

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: viewtrip
    scheme: https
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["traxjourney.com"]
    authorization:
      credentials: "<METRICS_TOKEN>"   # or credentials_file: /etc/prometheus/viewtrip.token
```

Defence in depth — block the path at the proxy so only a local scraper (or an
SSH tunnel to `127.0.0.1:8000`) can reach it:

```
traxjourney.com {
    handle /metrics { respond 403 }
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
}
```

Quick check:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $METRICS_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics | head
```

## What is collected

All metric objects live in one module, `src/utils/metrics.py`.

### HTTP — `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `viewtrip_http_requests_total` | `method`, `handler`, `status` |
| `viewtrip_http_request_duration_seconds` | `method`, `handler` |
| `viewtrip_http_request_size_bytes`, `viewtrip_http_response_size_bytes` | `handler` |
| `viewtrip_http_requests_inprogress` | — |

`handler` is the **route template** (`/api/projects/{name}`), never the
concrete path. Status codes are deliberately not grouped into `2xx`/`4xx`:
409 (optimistic-lock conflict) and 401-vs-404 are individually actionable.
The in-progress gauge is what tells a slow request apart from a stuck one
(issue #45).

### Authentication

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `viewtrip_logins_total` | `provider` (`password`\|`google`), `result` (`success`\|`failure`) |
| `viewtrip_registrations_total` | `provider` |

Google sign-in has no separate sign-up call, so `registrations_total{provider="google"}`
fires on first sight of an account and never again.

### Third-party APIs

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `viewtrip_external_requests_total` | `service`, `endpoint`, `outcome` |
| `viewtrip_external_request_duration_seconds` | `service`, `endpoint` |

`service` ∈ `strava`, `polarsteps`, `google_translate`, `smtp`. `endpoint` is
templated (`/activities/{id}/streams`). `outcome` ∈ `success`, `client_error`,
`auth_error`, `rate_limited`, `server_error`, `exception`.

Strava counts **every retry attempt**, because each one spends real quota.

Strava's own quotas are tracked separately (issue #130):

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `viewtrip_strava_rate_limit_usage` | `window` (`15min`\|`daily`) |
| `viewtrip_strava_rate_limit_capacity` | `window` |
| `viewtrip_strava_throttled_total` | `window` |

`throttled_total` counts calls **our own** limiter refused before they reached
Strava — distinct from `outcome="rate_limited"`, which means Strava returned a
429. Usage is process-wide, which is the same single-worker assumption noted
under *Constraints*: a second worker would keep its own count and the app could
exceed the quota by a factor of the worker count.

### Background jobs

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `viewtrip_job_runs_total` | `job`, `result` (`success`\|`error`\|`missed`) |
| `viewtrip_job_duration_seconds` | `job` |
| `viewtrip_job_last_success_timestamp_seconds` | `job` |

Fed by a single APScheduler listener, so every job — `daily_backup`,
`wal_checkpoint`, anything added later — is covered automatically.

### Database

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `viewtrip_db_queries_total`, `viewtrip_db_query_duration_seconds` | `operation` (SQL keyword only) |
| `viewtrip_db_session_duration_seconds` | — |
| `viewtrip_db_errors_total` | `kind` (`pool_timeout`\|`locked`\|`operational`\|`other`) |
| `viewtrip_db_pool_connections` | `state` (`in_use`\|`idle`) |
| `viewtrip_db_pool_overflow`, `viewtrip_db_pool_capacity` | — |
| `viewtrip_db_file_size_bytes` | `file` (`main`\|`wal`) |
| `viewtrip_stale_writes_total` | — |

Pool and file-size gauges are computed at scrape time, so they cost nothing
between scrapes.

## Alerts worth having

| Symptom | Signal |
|---|---|
| Pool exhaustion — the issue #35 hang | `viewtrip_db_pool_connections{state="in_use"}` approaching `viewtrip_db_pool_capacity` (60), or any `viewtrip_db_errors_total{kind="pool_timeout"}` |
| WAL checkpointing has stopped | `viewtrip_db_file_size_bytes{file="wal"}` climbing without ever dropping — `wal_autocheckpoint=0` means only the `wal_checkpoint` job folds it back |
| Backup silently stopped | `time() - viewtrip_job_last_success_timestamp_seconds{job="daily_backup"} > 90000` |
| Strava quota nearly spent | `viewtrip_strava_rate_limit_usage / viewtrip_strava_rate_limit_capacity > 0.8` — imports start deferring past this |
| Strava quota actually hit | any `viewtrip_strava_throttled_total` (our limiter refused), or `viewtrip_external_requests_total{service="strava",outcome="rate_limited"}` (Strava refused) |
| Credential stuffing | `rate(viewtrip_logins_total{result="failure"}[5m])` |
| Write contention | `rate(viewtrip_stale_writes_total[5m])` |

## Constraints

- **Per-process registries.** Metrics live in the process' memory and
  `entrypoint.sh` runs one uvicorn worker, so a scrape sees everything that
  process served.
  It does **not** see another process. Two things put work outside the API
  process: a job `worker` container (`REDIS_URL` set — see issue #173), whose
  queued jobs record DB-session timings and `viewtrip_stale_writes_total` in
  their own registry; and multiple gunicorn workers, were that ever adopted.
  Both need `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` pointing at a directory every process
  mounts — `/metrics` then aggregates the samples written there instead of
  reading its own registry. Unset, a scrape silently under-reports rather than
  failing, which is the trap worth knowing about.
- **Restarts reset counters.** That is normal — PromQL's `rate()`/`increase()`
  handle counter resets; only ever alert on rates, not absolute totals.
- **No label may carry user data.** Paths go through `normalise_path` and SQL
  through the operation keyword before being labelled. A label whose values
  come from user input creates one time series per distinct value.
- There is **no Prometheus/Grafana deployment yet** — this issue ships the
  endpoint only. Standing up the scraper is tracked separately.
