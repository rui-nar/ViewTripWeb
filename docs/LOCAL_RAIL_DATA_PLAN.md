# Local rail data — implementation plan

Tracking issue: **#345**. This plan covers acquiring the data, storing it,
keeping it current, changing the resolver to use it, and the tests at each step.

The measurements it rests on are in #345 and are not repeated here beyond what a
decision needs.

---

## The shape of the thing

Today `get_rail_geometry` asks Overpass three questions and Overpass answers them
over the network:

1. *What station is near this coordinate, and what is its UIC code?* (`_enrich_uic`)
2. *Which `route=train` relation covers both endpoints?* (strategies A and B)
3. *Give me every railway way in this bounding box.* (strategy C)

Only question 3 is expensive, and all three are lookups against a slowly-changing
dataset. **Overpass is a data source here, not an algorithm** — `_build_rail_graph`,
`_nearest_node` and `_dijkstra` are already ours and already run locally. So this
is a substitution of the source, not a rewrite of the resolver.

That framing sets the acceptance bar: **the strategies keep their current shape and
their current tests; only where the elements come from changes.**

---

## Phase 0 — Coverage *(DECIDED)*

**Europe, per-country files. Overpass remains the fallback outside Europe.**
Coverage widens gradually once this is proven in production.

That choice is deliberately conservative in both directions. Europe is where the
product's trips are, and per-country granularity is what keeps RAM bounded
(Phase 2) — Germany alone is 319 MB resident, so a single Europe-wide graph is
not an option. Keeping Overpass for the rest of the world means a user who
travels outside coverage still gets a route rather than an apology, and it
reduces the migration's blast radius to "the regions we hold".

The fallback is safe *because* of the volume maths that motivated this work: once
European segments resolve locally, Overpass sees a handful of requests a day
instead of several per resolve. That is comfortably inside fair use, so the
dependency stops being a structural ban risk even though it still exists.

**Consequences that bind later phases:**

- Region selection must be able to say "not covered" and hand off, so the source
  interface in Phase 3 needs a third outcome besides success and failure.
- Coverage is configuration, not code. Adding a country is a manifest change and
  a rebuild, never a deploy of new logic.
- The comparison in Phase 4 only applies within covered regions; outside them
  both sources are the same source.

---

## Phase 1 — The extract pipeline *(CI, not the VPS)*

**The 34.9 GB Europe raw file must never touch the VPS.** It does not fit
alongside prod and val on 40 GB. Build the artifact in CI and ship only the result.

- A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow downloads the Geofabrik extracts for the
  regions from Phase 0, filters each to rail with the `osmium` CLI (not pyosmium —
  the spike measured 2,022 s for Germany in Python; the C++ tool is far faster),
  and publishes the filtered artifacts.
- Filter selection **must match the current Overpass queries exactly**, or results
  change for reasons unrelated to this work:

  | | selection | serves |
  |---|---|---|
  | ways | `railway` in `(rail, narrow_gauge, light_rail)` **without** `service` | `_via_coordinate_fallback` |
  | relations | `route` in `(train, railway, light_rail)` | `_route_relation_segment`, `_via_train_relations_endpoints` |
  | nodes | **any** node carrying `uic_ref` | `_route_relation_segment` |
  | stations | node, **way or relation** with `railway` in `(station, halt)` and `uic_ref` | `_find_station_near` |

  The last two rows are wider than they look and the width is load-bearing. An
  earlier version of this contract specified "station/halt nodes with `uic_ref`"
  for both, derived from `_find_station_near` alone — but `_route_relation_segment`
  matches `node["uic_ref"=X]` with **no** railway filter, and relations reference
  the *stop* node rather than the station node. Stop nodes are routinely untagged
  as stations: in Luxembourg, 20 relation members carry a `uic_ref` and none is
  tagged `station` or `halt`, so the narrow filter made strategy A find nothing
  where Overpass finds relations today. `_find_station_near` likewise matches ways
  and relations, not just nodes, so polygon-mapped stations were being dropped.

  Verify any change to this table against `src/services/overpass_service.py`
  directly — the queries there are the specification, not this document.
- Publish per-region, versioned by the source extract's date, with a manifest
  recording region, source date, checksum and size.

**Where the artifact lives** is a real decision with a wrong answer: baking it into
the Docker image couples data refresh to a code release and inflates every image.
Prefer a release asset or object store the container fetches on boot and caches on
the mounted volume, so data and code move independently.

### Tests
- The filter selection is asserted against a checked-in fixture extract (a small
  bbox, a few hundred KB) so a tag-selection change fails CI rather than silently
  altering coverage.
- Manifest schema and checksum verification.
- A guard that the workflow never writes a raw extract into the image or the repo.


---

## The Phase 1 / Phase 2 contract

Fixed here so the two phases can be built independently and in parallel.

**Phase 1 produces**, per region, and publishes as a versioned artifact:

- `<region>-rail.osm.pbf` — the filtered extract.
- `manifest.json` — one entry per region:

```json
{
  "schema": 2,
  "generated_at": "2026-09-06T18:00:00Z",
  "regions": [
    {
      "region": "europe/germany",
      "status": "ok",
      "file": "germany-rail.osm.pbf",
      "source": "https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany-latest.osm.pbf",
      "source_date": "2026-09-05",
      "sha256": "...",
      "bytes": 10000000,
      "ways": 130713,
      "relations": 2179,
      "stations": 5483,
      "bbox": [5.87, 47.27, 15.04, 55.06]
    },
    {
      "region": "europe/andorra",
      "status": "empty",
      "source": "https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/andorra-latest.osm.pbf",
      "source_date": "2026-09-05"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Three outcomes, not two

A region's build ends as `ok`, `empty` or `failed`, and the manifest records the
first two. **`empty` is the Phase 0 "third outcome" made concrete on the data
side**: the pipeline ran correctly and the region holds **no rail ways**.

- `ok` — rail ways exist. The `.pbf` is published and the entry is the full
  record above.
- `empty` — no rail ways. The matrix job exits **0**, **no artifact is
  published**, and the entry carries `status: "empty"` with no `file`, `sha256`,
  `bytes` or `bbox` — there is nothing to download and nothing it covers.
  **Phase 3 must read an `empty` region as "we know there is no rail here":**
  fall back to Overpass exactly as for an unlisted region, and never treat it as
  a build that has yet to happen.
- `failed` — anything else. The job exits non-zero and the region is simply
  absent from the manifest.

The discriminator is rail ways and nothing else, which is the same predicate
`src/rail/builder.py` refuses a store on (`no railway ways — not a rail
extract`). The two must agree or Phase 1 publishes files Phase 2 rejects: four
configured regions sit in that gap today — Andorra, Malta and the Azores have no
railway at all, and Liechtenstein's only line is currently tagged
`railway=construction`, which gives it stations and UIC nodes but no ways.

Absence therefore means failure, and the publish job treats it that way: a run
whose manifest covers fewer regions than the run was supposed to build refuses
to publish and names them, because an uncovered region falls back to Overpass —
the service this whole plan exists to stop depending on. A subset rebuild
(`workflow_dispatch` with `regions: europe/denmark`) merges into the manifest of
the release it patches rather than replacing it.

### `bbox`

`bbox` is what Phase 3 uses to decide which region covers a coordinate, so it is
required for an `ok` region and must be the extract's true extent, not the
country's nominal one. It is `[min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat]` **over the
nodes of the rail ways only** — the same extent `src/rail/builder.py` writes to
the store's `meta` and `RailStore.bbox` reports. Bare `uic_ref` nodes and
platform or siding geometry are excluded from it deliberately: they are in the
file for other reasons and would claim coverage the routable data does not have.

**Region boxes overlap, and Phase 3 decided not to break the tie at all.**
These are country extracts, so their true extents interleave: Luxembourg City
falls inside four configured regions' boxes, Bratislava three, Zurich three.
Nothing in Phase 1 or Phase 2 ranks them, and picking the first match in
manifest order would be an accident rather than a decision. Phase 3's answer is
to query *every* candidate and merge the results (see *Region selection* below),
so no ranking is needed and a coordinate near a border is not forced to choose
the wrong side.

**Phase 2 consumes** a filtered `.pbf` and owns everything after it: the store
format, the builder, and the reader. **Where the store is built — in CI as part of
the artifact, or on the box at first use — is Phase 2's decision**, to be made on a
measurement rather than in advance. If it turns out to belong in CI, Phase 1 gains
one step that calls Phase 2's builder; nothing else moves.

Neither phase may import from the other except through these two surfaces.


## Phase 2 — The local store

The spike used a pickle of way geometries. That was right for measuring and wrong
to ship: pickle is not a stable format, loads all-or-nothing, and 319 MB resident
for Germany is the whole budget for a single country.

Requirements, in priority order:

1. **Bounded memory.** Never hold more than a couple of regions at once.
2. **Fast point lookup.** `_nearest_node` is a linear scan today — 1.43 s over
   Germany's 1.1 M nodes, called twice per resolve. This is the single largest
   avoidable cost and needs a spatial index.
3. **Fast load.** A cold region should cost well under the 8.41 s the spike's
   naive build took.
4. **Inspectable.** A format we can query by hand when a route looks wrong.

SQLite with an R-tree index fits all four, matches the existing stack, and needs no
new service. One file per region — `src/rail/store.py` reads what
`src/rail/builder.py` writes: ways with packed geometry, station/UIC lookup,
relation membership, and R-tree indices over way and station bounding boxes.
An in-process LRU bounds how many region files are open at once.

**Decided, on measurements (see the PR for issue #345 Phase 2):**

- **The store holds no graph**, which answers the open question about persisting
  the adjacency graph: neither. Strategy C already works on a bounding box, so a
  bbox query returns only the ways the route needs — Hamburg→Flensburg is 4,422
  of Germany's 130,713 ways and a 33.5k-node graph, not the country's 1,137,563.
  Resolving it costs 62 MB resident against the 319 MB the whole-country graph
  needs, and 0.15 s end to end. Requirement 3 (fast load) stops applying: there
  is nothing to load, and opening a region is 0.8 ms.
- **The memory did not disappear, it moved to the caller's bounding box** — about
  268 bytes per vertex, doubling once `_build_rail_graph` runs. Hamburg→Munich is
  284,607 vertices (~150 MB, measured 204 MB resident for the whole resolve); the
  whole-Germany box is 1,270,497 (~680 MB) on a 1 GB worker. `ways_in_bbox`
  therefore enforces its own vertex ceiling and raises rather than allocate
  (Phase 3's merge across overlapping regions holds the same bound, by counting
  every candidate region before it decodes any of them — see *Region selection*
  below), and
  `_RAIL_BBOX_MAX_AREA` in the resolver guards the same failure from the other
  end: it is a memory bound now, not an Overpass workaround, and must survive
  Phase 6.
- **A spatial index replaces the linear snap, at parity.** `nearest_node` over
  Germany is 0.4–1.5 ms against 0.67 s for the same scan over the whole-country
  graph in this process (1.43 s in the spike), and it returns the *identical*
  vertex — including `_nearest_node`'s squared-degree ordering, which is wrong as
  geometry and kept anyway because this phase substitutes the source and nothing
  else. Ranking by metres instead moved 0.53% of ±200 m snaps into a different
  connected component. Snapping is Phase 4's to fix, against a stable baseline.
- **The store is built in CI**, as one more step in the Phase 1 pipeline calling
  `python -m src.rail.builder`. Germany builds in 23.9 s at 196 MB peak — small
  enough that first-use building on the box would work, and pointless: it would
  put the `.pbf` and the builder on a VPS that needs neither, and pay that cost
  again after every container restart with an empty volume. Cost of the choice is
  transfer size: the store is larger than the extract it is built from (Germany
  58 MB from 23 MB, 28 MB gzipped).

### Tests
- Round-trip: filtered extract → store → the same element shapes
  `_build_rail_graph` consumes today.
- Spatial index correctness: nearest-station and nearest-node queries against
  brute-force results on a fixture region.
- LRU eviction bounds resident memory below a stated ceiling.
- Load time for the largest region stays under budget (a perf test with a
  generous threshold, to catch regressions rather than police milliseconds).

---

## Phase 3 — Resolver integration

Introduce a source interface with two implementations — the existing Overpass one
and the local one — so the three strategies are unchanged and switchable by config.
That is what makes the comparison period in Phase 4 possible at all.

- `_enrich_uic` becomes a local station lookup. Note the spike's finding that UIC
  coverage swings from 0.3 % (Denmark) to thousands of stations (Germany); locally
  the lookup is free either way, so no behaviour need change.
- Strategies A and B query local relations.
- Strategy C loads the region's graph instead of issuing a bbox query.
- **Region selection** from the segment's endpoints, including the case where a
  route crosses a border — the plan's first genuinely new logic. Two adjacent
  regions must be loadable and joinable, or cross-border rail silently degrades.

**Decided in Phase 3 (PR #351), on the user's call:**

- **Query every candidate region and merge; do not rank them.** Candidates are
  every region whose manifest bbox intersects the query area, computed *per
  query* rather than per resolve. Point lookups take each region's minimum and
  then the global minimum, which is the answer a single merged store would give.
  `relations_near` unions. `ways_in_bbox` merges and deduplicates by way id.
  Relation members are merged too: each extract holds only its own side of a
  border while Overpass returns the whole relation, so merging moves toward
  parity rather than away from it. This is why no tiebreak is needed.
- **A local failure defers to Overpass, with one deliberate exception.** One
  mechanism at the top of `get_rail_geometry`: if the local attempt degrades,
  the whole segment is retried against Overpass. That covers near-zero regions
  (Cyprus publishes 2 rail ways, Iceland 1), an `empty` entry, a missing
  directory or manifest, a manifest that is malformed in any way, a store file
  that is absent, or present and unreadable **when it is opened**, and a
  coordinate outside every region. The exception is the vertex ceiling, which
  straight-lines on purpose — see the next bullet. The guard is deliberately
  wide: a narrow `except` here took down every train resolve in review, because
  the file is still corrupt on each of RQ's three retries
  (`src/jobs/queue.py`: `Retry(max=3, interval=[10, 30, 60])`) and the job then
  fails for good. Per-operation fallback was rejected — it would fire an
  Overpass query whenever a covered region legitimately has no relation for a
  pair, which is common, and would have preserved essentially all of today's
  traffic.

  **Closed in #352:** the guard wrapped opening a store, not querying one, so a
  `sqlite3.DatabaseError` from an already-open connection escaped into the job.
  Both halves are now in place. The delivery step publishes by atomic rename
  only (see *Delivery*), so a refresh cannot pull a file out from under an open
  connection — and `_ask` in `rail_source.py` guards the query calls anyway,
  because SQLite reads pages lazily and a file whose header and `meta` are
  intact can still meet a corrupt page on the first query that touches it. That
  guard names `sqlite3.DatabaseError` and only it: wide is right for *opening* a
  file, where what it raises is not ours to enumerate, and wrong for *querying*
  one, where a blanket `except` would answer a defect in this module's own
  merging or scoping with "region not covered" — the one answer that looks
  exactly like success.
- **A bbox query over the vertex ceiling straight-lines and does not fall
  back.** The ceiling bounds *our* memory, not Overpass's patience: if Overpass
  answered, `_build_rail_graph` would rebuild the allocation just refused, on
  the same worker, after the most expensive query we know how to ask. Note this
  is **not** the pre-Phase-3 behaviour: `OverpassRailSource.ways_in_bbox` has no
  vertex ceiling, and the only size guard before Phase 3 was
  `_RAIL_BBOX_MAX_AREA`, so a 9 sq° box holding 1.2 M vertices used to be
  answered and the ~680 MB graph built. The local path is deliberately more
  conservative, and Phase 4's comparison must expect that difference rather than
  read it as a regression. The budget is charged for *deduplicated* vertices, so
  overlapping candidates do not each spend it — charging raw totals degraded the
  effective ceiling toward `_MAX_BBOX_VERTICES / N` exactly at borders, where
  overlap is greatest.

  **Closed in #352, by counting before decoding.** Deciding the merged total
  *after* decoding each region left the regions already merged and the region in
  hand alive at once, so two candidates near the ceiling transiently held twice
  it. Now `RailStore.vertex_counts_in_bbox` answers the same box as
  `ways_in_bbox` with `{way id: vertex count}` — the per-way form of the
  `SUM(LENGTH(geom))/8` scan `ways_in_bbox` already did, ids included so the
  merge can drop the border ways both extracts hold — and
  `LocalRailSource.ways_in_bbox` collects that from every candidate, merges by
  id, checks the exact total, and only then decodes. The accounting is exact
  rather than incremental, and the peak is the answer alone:

  | | peak allocated |
  |---|---|
  | 2 regions at the ceiling, before | 392.2 MB |
  | 2 regions at the ceiling, after | 0.3 MB |
  | 4 regions at the ceiling, after | 0.5 MB |
  | 2 regions merging to the ceiling (accepted) | 196.1 MB before, 196.2 MB after |

  Measured with synthetic stores and disjoint way ids, `tracemalloc` around the
  call. The cost is one more index scan per candidate region: on Germany's real
  store a 9 sq° Rhine-Ruhr box goes from 278 ms to 328 ms for one region and
  829 ms to 961 ms for two, about +18%. Roughly 90% of that is `ways_in_bbox`
  re-running its own `SUM` after the merge already counted the same rows; that
  guard is kept unconditional deliberately, as a backstop no caller can opt out
  of, and buying the 50 ms back would mean adding one.
- **`RailStore.nearest_node` is deliberately not in the interface.** The
  resolver builds its own graph and snaps with `_nearest_node` over it;
  exposing the store's spatial index would change snapping, which is Phase 4's
  to change against a stable baseline.
- **Config is `RAIL_SOURCE` (default `overpass`) and `RAIL_DATA_DIR`**, so
  merging Phase 3 is a production no-op until Phase 4 flips it deliberately.
  Coverage is re-read periodically rather than cached for the life of the
  worker: a refresh is picked up without a restart, and a manifest read that
  loses a race with a rebuild does not pin that worker to Overpass forever.

### Tests — what was actually built

- **Parity per strategy**, in `tests/test_rail_source.py`: each of A, B, C and
  the station lookup returns a byte-identical polyline from the local store and
  from an Overpass response carrying the same data. The oracle is independent
  SQL, not a call into `RailStore`. Note its limit honestly: both sides read the
  same file, so this proves the local source returns what the *store holds*, not
  what *Overpass* returns — a builder defect would be invisible to it. That is
  the right thing for a phase whose contract is "substitute the source"; closing
  the remaining gap is Phase 4's comparison, against live Overpass.
- **Cross-border resolution** over a synthetic two-region fixture whose
  endpoints are far enough apart that a single-endpoint scope reaches only one
  region — the earlier fixture's endpoints were 0.10° apart and could not tell
  the two apart.
- **Outside coverage**, and every way the local source can fail: no directory,
  no manifest, a malformed manifest of each shape, an unknown schema, a missing
  store file, a store file present but truncated or of the wrong schema, and an
  `empty` entry.
- **No network access**, at two levels: the transport asserted uncalled, and
  `socket.socket` refused outright on a local hit.

The existing rail tests in `tests/test_vr_hafas.py` and the resolve tests keep
running against the Overpass source, which the default leaves in place; running
the whole of them against the local source needs fixtures for every route they
cover and is deferred to Phase 4, where the comparison harness builds them.

## Delivery — getting the data onto the box *(BUILT)*

Phase 1 publishes extracts, Phase 2 reads stores and Phase 3 chooses between
them by config. Nothing populated `RAIL_DATA_DIR`: that step fell between
phases and belonged to nobody. It is `scripts/fetch_rail_data.py`, run on the
box, and it is what Phase 5 schedules and monitors rather than something Phase
5 still has to invent.

**It fetches extracts and builds the stores here, rather than downloading
prebuilt stores**, because the release holds extracts and only extracts. Phase
2 chose to build in CI and the pipeline does not yet do it; that decision is
not reversed, and if the workflow gains the step this script gets simpler
rather than obsolete. Building on the box is affordable in the meantime —
Germany is ~12 s and ~200 MB peak — and the extract is a fraction of the size
of the store it produces (Germany 10 MB against 58 MB, a sixth; Luxembourg,
measured on the published asset, 0.33 MB against 1.36 MB, a quarter), so it
moves less over the network, not more. It needs `pyosmium`, which is in
`requirements.txt` and therefore already in the image. The image was missing
`libexpat1`, without which `import osmium` fails on `python:*-slim`; the
Dockerfile now installs it, and `.dockerignore` un-excludes the one script in
`scripts/` that has to be *in* the image rather than in CI.

**The contract, which Phases 4 and 5 may rely on:**

- **`RAIL_DATA_DIR` holds `manifest.json` (schema 2, entries verbatim from the
  release) and one `<region>.rail.sqlite` per `ok` region installed**, plus a
  `.sha256` sidecar per store recording the asset it was built from, and a
  `.incoming/` working directory holding nothing but its `.lock` between runs.
  Each run stages in its own subdirectory of it and removes it when it ends; a
  run killed outright (an OOM kill is the realistic case) leaves that
  subdirectory behind, and the next run clears it while holding the lock.
- **One refresh at a time.** A refresh takes an exclusive `flock` on
  `.incoming/.lock`; a second one does nothing and exits 0 rather than waiting.
  This is not tidiness: without it two runs share a staged path, `build_store`
  removes and rebuilds that path, and one run publishes the other's
  half-written file — with the *correct* digest recorded beside it, so every
  later run skips the region as up to date and the corruption is permanent.
  Whatever Phase 5 schedules must not assume a run has finished before the
  next one starts; it does not have to, because this holds.
- **Every file appears by atomic rename, never by being written in place** —
  the stores, the manifest and the `.sha256` sidecars alike.
  The work directory is inside `RAIL_DATA_DIR` so the rename cannot cross a
  filesystem. **This closes the known gap Phase 3 left open above** — "either
  widen the guard to the query calls or make the refresh contract
  atomic-rename-only" (#352, finding 2) — by taking the second option: a
  worker holding a store open keeps the old inode and its query finishes
  against whole, valid data. #352 then took the first option as well, for the
  corruption a rename cannot prevent — a page that goes bad on disk under a
  connection that already opened the file. It is a contract, not an implementation detail,
  and `tests/test_rail_data_fetch.py` holds a `RailStore` open across a real
  refresh to prove it. Replacing the rename with an in-place copy makes that
  test fail by returning *zero* ways rather than by raising — the silent shape
  of the failure. That test alone does not catch *building* straight into
  `RAIL_DATA_DIR`, because `build_store` unlinks its output first and the
  held-open reader survives that too; a second test covers the two failures
  that would reintroduce — a reader *opening* the store part-way through a
  ~12 s build, and a build that raises leaving the region with no store at
  all — by asserting the destination is byte-identical to what it held before
  and never partial while the build runs.
- **The installed manifest describes what is on disk, never what was
  intended.** A region that fails keeps the entry it had, because the store it
  describes is still there; a region installed this run gets the new entry.
  `generated_at` advances only when every region converged, so a partial
  refresh cannot report a freshness it does not have — Phase 5 alerts on data
  age, and an optimistic timestamp is the failure that looks like success.
  Per-region age is each entry's `source_date`.
- **Re-running converges and costs only what changed.** A region whose sidecar
  matches the manifest's `sha256` is skipped without a download.
- **Nothing is trusted unverified.** An asset whose size or sha256 disagrees
  with the manifest is refused, the region keeps its existing store, and the
  run exits non-zero naming what was refused. A manifest of an unknown schema
  is refused whole, before anything is fetched, and so is an entry whose
  `status` this version does not know or that carries no `sha256` at all —
  there is nothing to verify against, so nothing may be installed.
- **A refresh needs no restart.** `_local_rail_source` rebuilds the source, and
  with it the store cache, every `_LOCAL_SOURCE_TTL_S`, so new data is live
  within five minutes — which is why the atomic rename has to hold for those
  five minutes rather than merely for an instant.
- **Bounded**: one region's extract plus its store, and the extract is deleted
  as soon as the store exists.
- **Unauthenticated.** The repository is public, so the releases API and the
  asset URLs answer with no token (verified, not assumed). The step takes no
  credentials.

Deliberately *not* built here: any schedule. Running it at container boot was
rejected — it would block startup or race the workers on a first install, and
the data is on a volume that outlives the container, so boot is not when the
question arises. The operational procedure is in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_VPS.md`, §9.

## Phase 4 — Comparison and cutover

Do not switch on faith. For a period, resolve through both sources and record where
they differ — strategy chosen, point count, path length, degraded flag.

This is also where the **known routing defects** get addressed, because they become
cheap to iterate on (0.15 s per experiment instead of a 45 s network round trip):

- **Snapping.** `_nearest_node` picks the geometrically closest node regardless of
  which connected component it is in, so a siding beside the platform beats the
  through line. Fix: prefer a node that can reach the destination.
- **Fragmentation.** Denmark 50 components (largest 65.6 %), Germany 1,143
  (87.6 %). Decide deliberately whether to include `service` ways — the spike
  showed doing so raises the largest component but breaks routes that previously
  worked, because it interacts with the snapping bug.

Treat these as **quality work enabled by the migration, not part of it** — land the
substitution first, with parity, then improve routing against a stable baseline.

### Tests
- A corpus of real segments with expected strategy and rough geometry, run against
  both sources, asserting parity within tolerance.
- Regression tests for each routing defect, written to fail against current
  behaviour first.

---

## Phase 5 — Maintenance

- Scheduled refresh (monthly is ample; rail alignment changes over years).
- Metrics: region load time, cache hit rate, resolve duration, outside-coverage
  rate, and **data age** — a silently stale extract is the failure mode here, and
  it looks exactly like success.
- An alert on data age exceeding the refresh interval.
- Document the refresh procedure and the manual-rebuild path in

## Phase 6 — Retire the scaffolding

Once the local source is authoritative, most of the Overpass remediation exists
only to manage a quota we no longer depend on: the resolve deadline, 429 backoff,
host cooldowns, `upstream_slots`, the concurrency limiter, and arguably
`upstream_cache`.

Keep the Overpass source itself if it remains the outside-coverage fallback — but
then it serves a handful of requests a day rather than several per resolve, which
is comfortably inside fair use and stops the ban risk being structural.

## Risks

| risk | mitigation |
|---|---|
| Local results differ from Overpass in edge cases | Phase 4 comparison period; parity tests before cutover |
| Extract goes stale unnoticed | data-age metric and alert; it is the failure that looks like success |
| RAM regression as coverage grows | LRU ceiling test in Phase 2 |
| CI build cost grows with coverage | per-region artifacts, refreshed independently |
| A user travels outside coverage | explicit Phase 0 decision, not an accident |

## What this does not change

HAFAS/MOTIS train lookup is a separate service and is untouched. The
`route_quality` modelling (D2), the job-liveness endpoint (D3) and distinct map
styling for approximate routes (D4) remain wanted and are independent of this work.
