# VPS Deployment (traxjourney.com)

Runbook for the OVH VPS, which now hosts **both** environments and has fully
replaced the Synology NAS:

- **production** — `traxjourney.com`, `/opt/viewtrip/`, image `:latest`
- **validation** — `val.traxjourney.com`, `/opt/viewtrip-val/`, image `:validation`

Validation moved off the NAS because its firewall could not be opened up enough
to serve the environment. Nothing about ViewTripWeb forced the move, so there is
no application-level workaround to look for — the NAS is simply no longer a
deployment target, and `deploy.ps1` no longer has a code path that reaches it.

## Infrastructure

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Domain | traxjourney.com (+ www, redirected to apex), val.traxjourney.com |
| Provider | OVH, VPS-1 2027 range |
| Specs | 2 vCore, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB NVMe SSD, Strasbourg (FR) datacenter |
| Image | Debian 12 - Docker (Docker preinstalled) |
| SSH user | `debian` (OVH default account, sudo + docker group) |
| Prod directory | `/opt/viewtrip/` (`db/`, `config/`, `data/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`) |
| Val directory | `/opt/viewtrip-val/` (same layout, own `.env`, own data) |
| Reverse proxy | Caddy (automatic Let's Encrypt TLS) |

## 1. VPS hardening

- SSH key auth only: generated a dedicated key locally
  (`~/.ssh/traxjourney_vps`), copied to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for the
  `debian` user, then in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
  - `PermitRootLogin no` (already default on the OVH image)
  - `PasswordAuthentication no`
  - `systemctl restart sshd` — **always verify the key login works from a
    fresh terminal before this step**, to avoid a lockout.
- Firewall: `ufw` (not raw `iptables` — Debian doesn't ship ufw by default,
  `apt install ufw` first). Rules: allow OpenSSH, 80/tcp, 443/tcp, then
  `ufw enable`.
- GHCR auth: logged in with a **read-only** PAT (`read:packages` scope only),
  not the push token used by `deploy.ps1` locally — limits blast radius if
  the VPS is ever compromised.

**Gotcha:** Docker manipulates `iptables` directly when a container port is
published (`ports:` in compose), and can bypass ufw's rules entirely. Fix:
bind published ports to loopback only, e.g. `"127.0.0.1:8000:8000"`, so the
port is reachable from Caddy on the same host but never exposed publicly
regardless of firewall state.

## 2. Caddy reverse proxy

Installed from Caddy's official apt repo. `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```
traxjourney.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
}

www.traxjourney.com {
    redir https://traxjourney.com{uri} permanent
}

val.traxjourney.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8001
}
```

Each hostname gets its own certificate automatically. No `tls` directive is
needed, and WebSocket upgrades pass through without extra configuration.

**Gotcha:** the Caddy Debian package ships a default `:80 { root * ...;
file_server }` block in the Caddyfile. This block has no hostname, so it
matches *any* host on port 80 and will intercept requests meant for your
domain block — including the ACME challenge for a newly added subdomain.
Delete it, don't just append your own block alongside it.

**DNS before reload.** A new hostname needs its A record live *before* the
first request, or the HTTP-01 challenge fails and Caddy backs off with a retry
timer. `dig` is not installed on the OVH Debian image (it is in `dnsutils`);
`getent hosts val.traxjourney.com` answers the same question with nothing to
install. If that comes back empty but the record is definitely published,
query a public resolver directly — `getent` goes through the local resolver
and can serve a stale negative answer:

```bash
curl -s "https://dns.google/resolve?name=val.traxjourney.com&type=A"
```

`caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile && systemctl reload caddy` after
any edit. Cert issuance is automatic on first request, provided DNS already
resolves and 80/443 are open.

## 3. App deployment

`/opt/viewtrip/docker-compose.yml` mirrors the NAS prod compose
(`/volume2/docker/viewtrip/docker-compose.yml`), with three differences:

- Port bound to loopback (`127.0.0.1:8000:8000`) instead of `7777:8000`.
- `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` / `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` point at `traxjourney.com`.
- `JWT_SECRET` freshly generated (`openssl rand -hex 32`) — not reused from
  the NAS, no reason to carry an old session-signing key to a new host.

All other env values (Mapbox, Google client ID/Translate key, Strava
client ID/secret) are unchanged from NAS prod.

**Before going live** (done for prod, and the same applies to any new
hostname — see §5): add the `https://traxjourney.com/...` equivalents to
Google OAuth console's authorized redirect URIs and Strava's app
"Authorization Callback Domain". Login and Strava sync fail on a domain that
is not registered there.

### Background job worker (optional, issue #173)

The API serves fine on its own: with `REDIS_URL` unset, every background job
(route resolution, poster rendering, share tiles, stats) runs inside the API
process via FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`. That is the original behaviour and a
reasonable setup for this instance's load.

Adding the `redis` + worker services buys two things:

- **Durability.** A job survives an API restart. Previously a restart mid-resolve
  left a segment on `route_status="pending"` forever, and the only recovery was
  client-side — it ran when someone happened to reopen the project.
- **A real concurrency bound.** An RQ worker runs one job at a time, so the
  number of processes listening on a queue *is* that queue's parallelism.

The bounds are not the same for every queue, which is why there are two worker
services rather than one scaled to two replicas (issue #188): `resolve` is
capped at 2 because Overpass rate-limits per IP and it is a free public service,
while `poster` is capped at **1** because two concurrent A0 renders are what
takes a small host out on memory. Identical replicas can only give every queue
the same bound, so they cannot express this.

`QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` in `src/jobs/queue.py` is the source of truth for those
numbers, and `tests/test_worker_topology.py` fails if the compose example stops
matching it. Change the map and the compose file together.

See `docker-compose.yml.example` for the service definitions. Three things about
it are easy to get wrong:

- The workers **must mount the same host paths** as the API container. The
  database is a SQLite file, so "sharing" it means sharing the volume, on one
  host. Two engines writing one file is fine — WAL and a 30 s `busy_timeout` are
  set on every connection (`models/db.py`) — but only on the same machine.
- Redis needs `--appendonly yes`. Without it, a broker restart silently drops
  every queued job, which is the exact failure the queue was added to fix.
- Do **not** publish Redis' port. Docker publishes ports by writing DNAT rules
  that bypass `ufw`, so "the firewall blocks it" is not true of a published
  port — and an unauthenticated Redis reachable from the internet is a
  well-known way to lose a host.

The workers set `VIEWTRIP_ROLE=worker`, which stops them running migrations, the
admin seed, and the scheduled jobs. Only the API container owns those: two
containers racing `alembic upgrade head` at boot, or each taking its own nightly
backup and 60 s WAL checkpoint, is the failure that guards against.

Keep both worker services on the **same image tag** as the API. They share one
image and only the API runs migrations, so a worker left on an older tag would
run stale job code against a schema it does not know about.

`deploy.ps1` needs no changes for any of this: it builds/pushes the image and
then runs `docker compose down && pull && up -d`, which is service-agnostic.
Adding the services to each host's compose file and the keys to its `.env` is
the whole deployment change.

**Rollback** is unsetting `REDIS_URL` and removing the worker services. No image
rebuild — jobs simply run in-process again.

If you scrape `/metrics`, also set `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` to a directory
both containers mount. Without it the scrape only sees the API process and
job-side DB metrics silently go missing (see docs/METRICS.md).

## 4. Data migration (NAS -> VPS)

*Historical — the one-time move of prod data off the NAS. Kept for the gotchas,
which apply to any Synology copy. To seed validation from prod, see §5.*

1. **Consistent DB snapshot on the NAS**, via SQLite's online backup API in a
   throwaway container (safe on a live DB — unlike a raw `cp`, correctly
   handles WAL mode, which the app already runs — see `models/db.py`):
   ```bash
   ssh -p 4488 Rui@narciso.synology.me "DOCKER=\$(command -v docker 2>/dev/null || ls /var/packages/ContainerManager/target/usr/bin/docker /var/packages/Docker/target/usr/bin/docker /usr/local/bin/docker 2>/dev/null | head -1); \$DOCKER run --rm -v /volume2/docker/viewtrip/db:/db python:3.11-slim python3 -c \"import sqlite3; s=sqlite3.connect('/db/viewtripweb.db'); d=sqlite3.connect('/db/migration_backup.db'); s.backup(d); d.close(); s.close(); print('backup done')\""
   ```
   **Gotcha:** `docker` isn't in `PATH` for non-interactive SSH sessions on
   Synology — same issue `deploy.ps1`'s remote script already works around;
   resolve the binary path explicitly as above.

2. **Stop the VPS container first** if anything is already running there —
   overwriting a SQLite file out from under a live connection risks
   corruption: `cd /opt/viewtrip && docker compose down`.

3. **Copy DB + data + config from NAS straight to the VPS** (no need to hop
   through a local machine — the VPS has direct SSH reach to the NAS):
   ```bash
   scp -O -P 4488 Rui@narciso.synology.me:/volume2/docker/viewtrip/db/migration_backup.db /opt/viewtrip/db/viewtripweb.db
   rsync -avz -e "ssh -p 4488" Rui@narciso.synology.me:/volume2/docker/viewtrip/data/ /opt/viewtrip/data/
   rsync -avz -e "ssh -p 4488" Rui@narciso.synology.me:/volume2/docker/viewtrip/config/ /opt/viewtrip/config/
   ```
   **Gotchas encountered:**
   - `scp` alone failed with `subsystem request failed` — modern OpenSSH
     clients default to SFTP-based scp, which Synology's sshd doesn't have
     enabled. Fix: `-O` forces the legacy SCP protocol.
   - Legacy `-O` scp doesn't support the `source_dir/.` trick for copying a
     directory's contents without the directory itself (`unexpected
     filename: .`) — use `rsync` for directories instead.
   - `rsync` wasn't runnable on the NAS until DSM's **Control Panel > File
     Services > rsync** service was explicitly enabled (installs/activates
     the `rsync` binary as a side effect, even though the connection here
     tunnels through SSH rather than using the native daemon protocol).
   - Ensure destination ownership is correct first (`sudo chown -R
     $USER:$USER /opt/viewtrip`) — Docker can leave bind-mount dirs owned by
     root from an earlier `up`.

4. `cd /opt/viewtrip && docker compose up -d`, then `docker compose logs -f`
   to confirm a clean Alembic migration + startup before checking the site.

## 5. Validation environment (`/opt/viewtrip-val`)

Same host, same Docker, same image repository — a second directory with its own
compose file, `.env` and data. Three things differ from prod:

- **Port `127.0.0.1:8001:8000`.** Loopback-bound for the reason in §1: Docker
  publishes ports by writing DNAT rules that bypass `ufw`, so a bare
  `8001:8000` would put validation on the public internet regardless of the
  firewall. Only Caddy needs to reach it.
- **Image `:validation`**, not `:latest`.
- **Its own `db/`, `data/`, `config/`.** Pointing val at `/opt/viewtrip/db`
  would put validation writes into the production SQLite file.

`.env` must set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` and `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` to
`val.traxjourney.com`, or CORS rejects the client and Strava's callback lands
on prod. Add `val.traxjourney.com` to Google OAuth's authorized redirect URIs;
Strava allows only one callback domain per app, so val either gets its own
Strava app or does without Strava sync.

**Use Stripe test keys and val's own webhook secret.** This matters more than it
looks once the section below is used: a database seeded from prod carries real
`stripe_customer_id` values, and val running unreleased code against live Stripe
keys can bill or mutate a real customer.

### Seeding val from the latest prod backup

Prod's nightly job writes `/opt/viewtrip/db/backups/viewtripweb_<YYYY-MM-DD>.db`
(`src/backup/backup_service.py`). Each file is self-contained —
`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` folds the WAL in — so there is no sidecar to carry
along. Both stacks are on one host, so a bind mount reaches them:

```yaml
  # One-shot: seed val's DB from prod's newest nightly backup.
  # Behind a profile so a routine `docker compose up -d` can never clobber
  # val — see "Run it" below for the commands.
  db-seed:
    image: alpine:3.20
    profiles: ["seed"]
    volumes:
      - /opt/viewtrip/db/backups:/prod-backups:ro
      - ./db:/db
    command:
      - sh
      - -euc
      - |
        latest=$$(ls -1 /prod-backups/viewtripweb_*.db 2>/dev/null | tail -n1)
        [ -n "$$latest" ] || { echo "no prod backup in /prod-backups"; exit 1; }
        echo "seeding val from $$latest"
        rm -f /db/viewtripweb.db-wal /db/viewtripweb.db-shm
        cp "$$latest" /db/viewtripweb.db
        echo done
```

**Run it** (from `/opt/viewtrip-val`, in this order — val must be stopped
before the copy, per the first gotcha below):

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose --profile seed run --rm db-seed
docker compose up -d
```

The `--profile seed` flag is required on that middle command — `db-seed` is
in the `seed` profile specifically so it never runs as a side effect of a
plain `docker compose up -d` (see the third gotcha below). `--rm` cleans up
the one-shot container after it exits; it isn't a long-running service.

Three things about it are easy to get wrong:

- **Deleting the `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars is not optional.** If val has been
  running, `./db` holds a WAL belonging to *val's* database. Drop a different
  `.db` next to it and SQLite replays that WAL onto the new file — a corrupt
  database, not a clean copy.
- **Run it with val stopped** (`docker compose down` first). Overwriting a
  SQLite file under a live connection is the same hazard as §4 step 2.
- **The profile is what keeps it safe.** Wired as a `depends_on:
  service_completed_successfully` dependency instead, every `docker compose
  up -d` would silently reset val, which makes it useless for testing anything
  that spans a deploy.

Backups are ISO-dated, so `ls -1 | tail -n1` really is the newest. `$$` is
compose escaping — the shell receives a single `$`.

Schema drift needs no action: val's API runs `alembic upgrade head` in its
lifespan, so a prod DB on an older revision migrates forward on first boot.

The database references media under `data/`, so a DB-only seed leaves memories
pointing at files that do not exist. Add `/opt/viewtrip/data:/prod-data:ro` plus
`./data:/val-data` and `cp -a /prod-data/. /val-data/` if you want them — check
free space first, it is a full copy of prod's media onto a 40 GB disk.

## 6. `deploy.ps1`

`-Target Validation|Prod` (default `Validation`). Both targets SSH to the VPS
(`164.132.195.154`, user `rui`, key `$HOME\.ssh\traxjourney_vps`) and run
`docker compose down / pull / up -d`; they differ in directory, image tag and
whether anything is built locally.

| | `Validation` | `Prod` |
|---|---|---|
| Directory | `/opt/viewtrip-val` | `/opt/viewtrip` |
| Image tag | `:validation` | `:latest` |
| Builds locally | yes (unless `-SkipBuild`) | never |
| URL | val.traxjourney.com | traxjourney.com |

```powershell
.\deploy.ps1                      # build working tree -> :validation -> val
.\deploy.ps1 -FromMain            # build a clean export of origin/main instead
.\deploy.ps1 -SkipBuild           # deploy the :validation CI already published
.\deploy.ps1 -Target Prod         # pull :latest, no build
```

`-FromMain` builds a pristine export of `origin/main` in a throwaway git
worktree, so the image is exactly what is on main — never contaminated by local
edits or untracked files.

Every path that skips the build first checks GitHub Actions for an in-progress
`docker-build.yml` run and refuses to deploy while one is going, since the tag
it is about to pull may be stale or only half-pushed.

Note `deploy.ps1` itself is **gitignored** and lives only on the dev machine.

### The other way to cut `:validation`

A session with no local Docker — a web Claude Code session, say — produces the
same image by force-pushing the floating `validation` git tag:

```bash
git tag -f validation <commit-or-branch>
git push origin validation --force
```

`docker-build.yml` builds `ghcr.io/rui-nar/viewtripweb:validation` on
`ubuntu-latest`. It is the **same tag** `deploy.ps1` pushes, so the val host
pulls it either way and needs no reconfiguration. Deploy it with
`.\deploy.ps1 -SkipBuild`, or directly on the VPS:

```bash
cd /opt/viewtrip-val && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

This path only ever produces `:validation` — never `:latest` or a `:<sha>` tag,
which stay reserved for real `v*` releases.

Building on Linux is also the only way to avoid issue #190: `deploy.ps1` builds
from a Windows working tree, which is how CRLF line endings on a `*.sh` file
baked a broken `#!/bin/sh\r` shebang into the image and crash-looped the worker
containers. `.gitattributes` pins shell scripts to LF, but only on a fresh
checkout of the affected path, not retroactively.

**One consequence of the shared tag:** two producers write `:validation`, and
the host cannot tell which one it is running. If a local build and a tag push
race, last writer wins. Prefer the tag route when it matters who built it.

## 7. Observability: Loki/Prometheus/Grafana on the NAS (issue #205)

Logs and metrics ship off this VPS to a stack colocated on the NAS —
generous disk there, no CPU contention with production traffic here. See
`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` for the NAS-side compose, retention, and the
LogQL/PromQL an operator actually runs. This section is only the VPS-side
half: the tunnel and the shipper.

### Tailscale tunnel

Deliberately not a port-forward + DDNS + bearer token, the way `/metrics`
is secured today (`docs/METRICS.md`) — the NAS has never had an inbound
port opened for anything but SSH, and a second internet-facing ingestion
endpoint there is a materially different risk than this VPS's already
locked-down setup (§1). Install Tailscale on both hosts instead, so
Loki/Prometheus never touch the public internet at all:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

Same on the NAS — DSM's Package Center or Container Manager, depending on
DSM version. `tailscale status` on either host shows the other's Tailscale
IP/MagicDNS name — that's what `LOKI_PUSH_URL` and
`PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL` below point at.

### Alloy (VPS side)

`docker-compose.yml.example`'s `alloy` service tails every container's logs
via the Docker socket (read-only) and scrapes `viewtripweb:8000/metrics`
over the compose-internal network — `/metrics` itself never needs to be
reachable from outside this host for this to work. Copy the example config
and fill in `.env`:

```bash
cp config/alloy-config.river.example config/alloy-config.river
```

```
LOKI_PUSH_URL=http://<nas-tailscale-host>:3100/loki/api/v1/push
PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL=http://<nas-tailscale-host>:9090/api/v1/write
```

**Not verified against a live Alloy binary** — `config/alloy-config.river.example`
is a documented starting point to adapt, the same spirit
`docker-compose.yml.example` itself already is. Confirm log lines and the
`viewtrip_*` metrics actually arrive in Grafana on the NAS before relying
on it for an incident.

### Dropping `/metrics`'s public exposure

Once Alloy's scrape is confirmed working, `/metrics` no longer needs the
bearer-token + Caddy-block setup in `docs/METRICS.md` — Alloy reaches it
over the internal compose network, never the public internet. Remove the
`handle /metrics { respond 403 }` Caddy block (§2) and unset
`METRICS_TOKEN`, or leave the token as defence in depth and just drop the
Caddy exposure — either is fine, but the token alone was always the weaker
of the two.

### Keep local rotation regardless

Every service in `docker-compose.yml.example` now sets `max-size`/`max-file`
on its `logging:` driver (previously unbounded — a latent disk-fill risk on
this 40GB host). This stays even with Loki live: if the NAS or the tunnel
is down during an incident, `docker compose logs` here must still answer
"what just happened" on its own.

## 8. Auto-deploy validation on new image (issue #205)

`deploy.ps1` needs a human at a Windows dev machine to redeploy validation.
`vps/webhook/` closes that loop: `docker-build.yml` finishing successfully
off the `validation` tag triggers a `docker compose pull && up -d` on
`/opt/viewtrip-val` automatically, with no runner registered in GitHub and
no SSH key stored in GitHub's secrets — the trust boundary stays entirely
on this VPS. Deliberately scoped to **validation only**: auto-deploying
prod on every release would remove `deploy.ps1 -Target Prod`'s existing
manual gate, which is a bigger safety call than "keep val fresh" and not
something to fold in as a side effect of this.

**Not verified against a live `webhook` binary from the session that wrote
this** — `vps/webhook/` is a documented starting point, same caveat as the
Alloy/Loki configs above.

### Install `webhook`

```bash
sudo apt install webhook   # Debian's own repo; check `webhook -version` after
```

If it's missing or too old there, grab a static binary from
[adnanh/webhook's releases](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/releases)
instead and drop it at `/usr/bin/webhook`.

### Configure the hook

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/viewtrip-val/webhook
cp vps/webhook/*.sh vps/webhook/hooks.yaml.example /opt/viewtrip-val/webhook/
cd /opt/viewtrip-val/webhook
mv hooks.yaml.example hooks.yaml
openssl rand -hex 32   # generate a secret, paste it into hooks.yaml AND
                        # into GitHub's webhook config below — same value
```

`hooks.yaml` is gitignored (the secret lives inline — `webhook` has no
env-var interpolation in its config), same pattern as `docker-compose.yml`
and `config/config.json` elsewhere in this repo.

### systemd unit

```bash
sudo cp /opt/viewtrip-val/webhook/webhook.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now webhook
sudo systemctl status webhook   # confirm it's listening on 127.0.0.1:9999
```

### Caddy routing

Loopback-bound (`127.0.0.1:9999`), same discipline as everything else in
§1 — add a `handle_path` block to the existing `traxjourney.com` site
(order matters: this must come before the catch-all `reverse_proxy
127.0.0.1:8000`, same as the existing `/metrics` block):

```
traxjourney.com {
    handle /metrics { respond 403 }
    handle_path /gh-webhook/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9999
    }
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
}
```

`handle_path` (not `handle`) strips the `/gh-webhook` prefix before
forwarding — `webhook`'s own server serves each hook at `/hooks/<id>`
relative to its own root (its default `-urlprefix`), so the public URL
ends up `https://traxjourney.com/gh-webhook/hooks/deploy-validation`.
`caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile && systemctl reload caddy`
after editing, per §2.

### GitHub-side webhook

Repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Payload URL | `https://traxjourney.com/gh-webhook/hooks/deploy-validation` |
| Content type | `application/json` |
| Secret | same value as `hooks.yaml`'s `secret` |
| Events | "Let me select individual events" → **Workflow runs** only |
| Active | checked |

No changes needed to `docker-build.yml` itself — repo webhooks subscribe to
workflow-run completions independently of the workflow's own
`permissions:` block.

### Verify

Force-push the `validation` tag (see §6's "other way to cut `:validation`")
and watch:

```bash
tail -f /opt/viewtrip-val/deploy.log
```

`deploy-validation.sh` logs each attempt (triggered/succeeded/failed) with
a UTC timestamp, and is `flock`-guarded so a retried GitHub delivery for
the same build can't run a second `pull`/`up -d` concurrently against the
same compose project.

## Open items

- [ ] Off-site backups independent of OVH (the VPS's datacenter, Strasbourg,
      is the same site that suffered OVH's 2021 fire — the in-house
      "Automated Backup" option isn't sufficient on its own).
- [x] Decommission the NAS as a deployment target. Validation moved to
      `/opt/viewtrip-val` on the VPS; `deploy.ps1` no longer reaches the NAS.
- [ ] Both environments now share one host, one disk and one 4 GB of RAM. A
      poster render in val competes with prod for memory — worth watching
      before assuming val is free. Confirmed a real constraint, not just a
      theoretical one (issue #209): a route resolution alone measured over
      512M in the API process. Sizing the per-container memory limits in
      `docker-compose.yml.example` generously enough to survive a real
      resolve/poster peak (~3.25 GB for one full stack) leaves too little
      headroom for a second full stack plus the OS on this 4 GB host —
      unresolved; needs either more host RAM or not running both stacks'
      workers at full concurrency simultaneously.
