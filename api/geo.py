#
# Down from 48 MB with issue #369, because a prepared line got smaller: 9 bytes
# per coordinate (the int32 pair plus its level byte) against 16, so the
# 219-activity trip the perf doc measures is ~7.9 MB rather than 15.5 MB, and
# the per-(level, line) memo that could add up to 16 MB on top of that is
# gone — filtering by level costs what a memo hit did. At ~36 KB per activity
# the entry cap below admits ~890 activities before a trip is refused, against
# ~500 at 48 MB and 16 bytes.
#
# That is the bound on what is *cached*, and it is not the process's peak. A
# whole-trip request at a deep level materialises every kept point into a
# list-of-lists before it is serialised — for the trip the perf doc measures
# that is up to ~876,000 coordinates, about 112 MB live at once. This is not
# new, but it is the number that matters on a container which has been
# OOM-killed at ~779 MB against a 768 MB cap. The cached bound is 32 MB; the
# transient peak is roughly twice what the largest single response contains,

# past it is not cached at ANY zoom, and every request then repeats the DB
# load and the unpacking — or, for a trip not yet prepared, the polyline
# decode: ~4 s of CPU-bound Python holding the GIL on a single-process
# uvicorn, which is the mechanism that produced real 502s on /meta and
# /low-res. At 32 MB and 16 bytes per coordinate that cliff arrived at ~490
# activities, which is a shape this project's own comments treat as real (a
# long trip at a few activities a day); at 9 bytes it is ~890.
#
# So the only trip refused is one that could not be held even alone. That

# at 768 MB (docker-compose.yml.example) — and issue #209's third incident was

      it simplifies anything. Simplifying from it is identical to simplifying
      from the original at every zoom, and it is at most 4,000 points however
      long the track is. Held flat: an ``array("i")`` of 1e5-scaled integers
      for an activity, which is what its ``activity_geo_prepared`` row holds
      (8 bytes per coordinate, and exact — see ``src/models/prepared_geo.py``),
      or an ``array("d")`` for a segment prepared in memory (16). Against 128
      for a ``[lon, lat]`` list, because this is the one part large enough for
      the difference to decide whether caching a trip is affordable at all:
      7.9 MB rather than 112 MB for the 219-activity trip issue #276 measured.
    * ``levels`` — one byte per point, the lowest zoom level that keeps it
      (:func:`vertex_levels`). Serving a level is then a filter over the
      working set rather than a Ramer-Douglas-Peucker pass over it: 35–56 ms
      for a whole 219-activity trip against 1–2.5 s, identical output
      (issue #369).
    * ``bbox`` — of the working set, which is exactly the geometry that can be
      served, so "can this box show it" is O(1) instead of a walk over every
      coordinate (0.24 s to 0.34 s per whole-trip request, measured).
    * ``floor`` — what a line the viewport cannot show is served at, and what
      a level that keeps too few points falls back to. Precomputed because it
      is the answer for most lines of a long trip at most zooms.

    ``points`` is a plain list rather than an array for a line whose positions
    carry a third element, which simplification preserves and packing to pairs
    would drop, and None for a line nothing can simplify — one shorter than
    three points (a two-point GPX fallback) or one whose coordinates are not
    numbers. ``floor`` then holds that line verbatim and is always what is

    """Serve *name*'s geometry simplified to roughly one pixel at *zoom*.

    The body of :func:`project_geo_simplified` — see there for what the answer
    means — shared with the token-scoped share route (issue #321) so a public
    viewer gets the same payload, and the same cache entries, an owner does.
    The caller decides *who* is asking and hands over the owner's id and the
    project name; everything from there on is identity-independent, which is
    also why nothing caller-specific may reach the cache keys.

    ``load_project`` is called only on a track-cache miss, and must read the
    project **fresh from the DB** — a light load is enough, the geometry comes
    from ``activity_geo_prepared`` (see :func:`_prepared_lines`). What it
    returns is prepared into an entry held for 15 minutes, so a caller's own
    short-lived project cache must not be its source: that would stretch that
    cache's staleness window to the track cache's (issue #321).

    Cached in two layers, because the two costs are different sizes.

    The *trip* — each line as the working set, per-vertex levels, bounding box
    and coarseness floor that every zoom is served from — is read from the
    rows the write path keeps, and prepared here only for rows that have none
    (issue #369; before that, preparing one decoded every activity polyline,
    1.83 s measured for a 219-activity trip, and every level then ran its own
    Ramer-Douglas-Peucker pass, 1–2.5 s more). It is both zoom- and
    box-independent, so one entry serves every level and every viewport.

    Serving from it is a filter per line — the points whose level is at most
    the one asked for — and the box decides which lines are worth filtering
    at all, so a request only pays for what it can show (issue #338). Neither
    #325's per-box builds (cheap but unshareable) nor #331's box-free levels
    (shareable but unskippable) had both.

    The *bytes* — this level restricted to this box and gzipped — are cached in
    front of that, keyed by the tile-snapped box as well, because serialising
    is not free either and a repeat request should cost nothing. A miss there
    falls through to the prepared trip, never to a rebuild.

    The box is snapped server-side (:func:`snap_bbox_to_tiles`) so an unsnapped
    client cannot mint an entry per pan pixel. Both layers are generation
    checked, so one bust per mutation still covers every level and every box —
    and, since the keys are the owner's, one bust covers the share route too.

    resolution — which is all the screen can show anyway. Zooming in asks for
    more, and gets it.

    An additional endpoint: ``/project`` is unchanged and still serves full
    resolution, for shipped clients and for anything that genuinely needs
    every point (track editing, export).

    ``bbox`` — ``minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`` — additionally scopes it to
    what is on screen (issue #324). Zoom bounds the detail, not the extent, so
    without it a deep zoom still returns the whole trip at that detail and
    simplifies all of it: measured at 6.98 s of server CPU for a 219-activity
    trip at zoom 15, against 0.19 s at zoom 9 — the cost RISES with zoom while
    the saving falls (issue #324). A line outside the box is reduced to the
    floor a whole-trip zoom would have given it and skips simplification
    entirely; no feature is ever dropped, because `geo` is read as a
    description of the whole trip elsewhere in the client.

    Optional, and ignorable. An older client sends no box and gets exactly
    what it did before; an older server ignores the parameter and serves the
    whole trip, which is a superset of what was asked for.
