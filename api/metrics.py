"""Prometheus scrape endpoint (issue #125).

Not under ``/api`` — ``/metrics`` is the conventional path scrapers default to.

Caddy reverse-proxies *every* path of the public domain to this app, so an
unauthenticated ``/metrics`` would publish the app's internals (user counts,
route names, error rates, DB file size) to anyone who asks. It therefore
requires a bearer token, and is switched off entirely until one is configured —
no token, no endpoint.
