"""REST travel-companion endpoints — project members and invite links
(issue #106; roles: issue #109; invite emails: issue #113).

Routes:
    POST   /api/projects/{name}/members/invite     — create (or return) the invite link token,
                                                       optionally emailing it
    DELETE /api/projects/{name}/members/invite     — revoke the invite link
    GET    /api/projects/{name}/members            — list members (owner first)
    DELETE /api/projects/{name}/members/{user_id}  — remove a member; a member removes themself
    GET    /api/projects/{name}/members/pending    — list invites emailed but not yet accepted
    DELETE /api/projects/{name}/members/pending/{id} — revoke one pending invite
    GET    /api/invites/pending                    — invites addressed to me
    GET    /api/invites/{token}                    — preview an invite (project + owner name + role)
    POST   /api/invites/{token}/accept             — join the project with the invite's role
    DELETE /api/invites/{token}                    — decline an invite addressed to me

Member management (invite create/revoke, removing editors/viewers) is
co-owner+. Only the strict owner may create a "co-owner" invite or remove a
co-owner (so co-owners can't lock each other out). Any member may leave.
Invites are blocked while the owner has E2EE enabled — companions could
neither read nor write content encrypted under the owner's CMK (see plan for
issue #106; key sharing is a follow-up).
