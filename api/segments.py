    Sometimes the auto-resolved OSM route is missing or malformed; this lets the

    route geometry changes here — start/end anchors, label, and date are
    untouched (those stay under ``update_segment``/the segment form).

    Marks the segment ``route_edited=True`` so a later auto-resolve
    (:func:`resolve_segment_route`) refuses to silently discard the edit
    unless the caller passes ``force``.

    Uses the same single-row payload write as the resolve job
    (``ItemOrderingMixin.update_segment_fields``, issue #173) rather than a

    Schedule OSM-based route resolution for a train, boat, or bus segment.

    Resolution (HAFAS stop sequence + Overpass track geometry) can take tens of
    seconds, so it runs as a background task rather than blocking the request —
    this is what previously caused proxy 504s on long routes.

    The segment is marked ``route_status="pending"`` synchronously and a 202 is
    returned immediately.  The client polls ``/meta`` until the segment flips to
    ``resolved`` or ``failed``.  See :func:`_resolve_route_job`.

    Marking pending is a payload write on one row, not a whole-project save
    (issue #173): triggering two resolves at once — or triggering one while
    another finishes — used to lose the optimistic lock and return a 409 the
    client never retried, so the second segment simply never resolved.

    Returns **409** instead if the segment has a manually edited route
    (``route_edited=True``, issue #150) and ``force`` is not set — an
    auto-resolve would otherwise silently overwrite the user's hand-drawn
    track. Pass ``force=True`` to proceed anyway; the client should confirm
    with the user first. A successful resolve clears ``route_edited``.
